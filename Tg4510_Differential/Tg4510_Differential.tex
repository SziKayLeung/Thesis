\subsection{Transcriptome abundance hierarchal between samples}
\textbf{Annotated genes}
Average XX of annotated genes (XX out of XX; range: XX, sd: XX) with an average length of XX was identified. No difference in number of annotated genes or distribution of isoforms in annotated genes was identified between Tg4510 and J20 mouse. Average XX full splice match isoforms were identified with no difference between Tg4510 and J20 mouse [Table X for breakdown]

Different splicing events annotated by SUPPA2. Reported differences in terms of numbers between types of splicing events in WT vs TG in Tg4510 and J20?

XX of known transcripts were identified to have intron retention; XX of known transcripts were identified to be fusion genes. XX of know transcripts identified to have non-sense-mediated decay. 


\subsection{Change in endogeneous expression}
%Check whether overexpression of human MAPT result in any unwanted, compensatory effects on equivalent mouse genes,as expression levels of mouse APP and MAPT should be slightly reduced, thereby suggesting no evidence that human transgene expression increase expression of directly-related mouse genes.
Supporting findings from \cite{Castanho2020}, human-specific MAPT sequences were only detected in CCS and FL reads from TG mice, confirming stable insertion and activation of MAPT transgene in TG mice.
