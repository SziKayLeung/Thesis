Single cell or nucleus transcriptomic profiling of AD post-mortem brain tissues reveal a heteregeonous cellular response to AD pathology with cell-type specific gene expression expressed detected, particularly at early stages of AD\cite{Mathys2019}. Highlighting the limitations of bulk tissue data in predominantly capturing gene expression changes in excitatory neurons\cite{Mathys2019} (likely due to higher abundance and subequently higher detection power), snRNA-Seq was able to capture genes with opposing directional changes, such as the upregulation of \textit{APOE} microglia but its downregulation in astrocytes.
