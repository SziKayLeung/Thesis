\chapter{Splicing signatures of progressive tau pathology in AD mouse model}\label{ch: transcriptional_global_differences}
%Classification of AS events, which most commonly observed/dominant? Isoforms derived from transcriptional regulation (alternative promoters) vs post-transcriptional regulation? 
%Impact of AS events on protein domains. Non-sense mediated decay? 
%%Furthermore changes in gene/transcript expression can be due to differences in cellular composition (i.e. neuronal loss/reactive gliosis) rather than indicative of disease-associated transcriptional regulation. 
%%Gene expression and mRNA isoforms vary widely across tissues (\cite{Wang2008}), thus sequencing the disease-relevant tissue (in this case entorhinal cortex) is important for understanding the pathology of AD. However, it is consequently important to note that other tissues may have to be considered to fully grasp the whole picture of AD development. 

\section{Introduction}
There is increasing evidence for the role of transcriptional dysregulation and aberrant splicing in AD development and pathogenesis. Recent studies have identified changes in splicing and transcript expression in human AD-postmortem brain tissues and AD transgenic mouse models. However to date, these studies rely on short-read RNA-Seq data, which is constrained for accurate detection and characterisation of RNA isoforms (as discussed in \cref{rnaseq_intro}). In contrast, we have illustrated the power of long-read sequencing to identify full-length transcripts and improve our annotations of alternatively spliced isoforms in the cortex of a mouse model of AD tauopathy, rTg4510 (\cref{ch: whole_transcriptome}). Following on from this work, this chapter aimed to exploit these long-read sequencing datasets generated from rTg4510 mice to identify transcriptional and splicing changes associated with progressive tau pathology.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Datasets}
All analyses pertaining to this chapter follow on from \cref{ch: whole_transcriptome} using the same Iso-Seq datasets generated from 12 female mice (wild-type controls = 6, rTg4510 transgenic = 6, aged 2 and 8 months, \cref{tab:whole_phenotype}). Briefly, RNA was prepared for Iso-Seq library preparation and PacBio SMRT sequencing on the Sequel (\cref{ch4_methods: isoseq_library}), followed by QC and data processing (\cref{ch4_methods: isoseq_data}); reads from individual samples were processed separately with \textit{IsoSeq3} and merged for transcript collapse with \textit{Cupcake}, genome alignment with \textit{Minimap2} and re-annotation with \textit{SQANTI3}. 

\subsection{Quantification of human MAPT transgene expression} 
The presence of human- and mouse-specific \textit{Mapt/MAPT} sequences was determined in FL transcripts as QC check of sample identity. Species-specific \textit{Mapt/MAPT} sequence, located in a 2kb region present in the 3'UTR, was identified after using BLAT\cite{Kent2002} to compare human and mouse MAPT/Mapt sequence for divergent transcript sequences \cite{Castanho2020}).  

\subsection{Characterisation of Alternative Splicing Events} 
Alternative splicing events were examined using a range of packages and custom scripts, as described and implemented in \cref{sec:AS_methods}, to assess whether there was a change in splicing patterns associated with rTg4510 pathology and across age. 


\subsection{Gene and Isoform Quantification}
Gene and isoform expression were estimated using two approaches: i) alignment of short-read RNA-Seq reads to the Iso-Seq-defined transcriptome (hybrid approach) using \textit{Kallisto}, and ii) normalised Iso-Seq full-length (FL) read counts (\cref{sec: gene_isoform_quant_explained}). FL read counts for each sample were extracted from \textit{Cupcake read\_stat.txt} file, using the sequencing run ID as identifier. 

To ease downstream quantitative analyses, ISM and shorter FSM transcripts annotated to the same known isoform (exemplified in \cref{fig:redudant_sncatranscripts}) were assumed as partial products of the longest detected FSM transcript, and thus removed with their associated counts aggregated (as shown in \cref{fig:ism_collapse}). Such products are likely to be technical artefacts from varying degrees of 5'degradation and truncation, generating shorter FSM transcripts with slightly different 5' and 3' ends while preserving internal exonic structure (small degree) and shorter ISM transcripts with matching but smaller overlap in exonic structure (large degree). Notably, significantly shorter ISM transcripts could in theory be mapped to multiple isoforms.

In this example, 6 isoforms were detected for "Gene 1", however, only 4 known isoforms were identified (denoted as ENMUST1-4). For ease of annotation and quantification, ISM and shorter FSM were assumed partial products of the longer FSM. Consequently, in the case where: 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item both ISM (PB.1.2) and FSM (PB.1.1) are annotated to the same transcript (shaded green), the FSM takes precedence as the associated transcript and counts from respective ISM are aggregated 
			\item there is one ISM (PB.1.3) but no corresponding FSM for the associated transcript (shaded blue), the ISM is retained
			\item there are multiple ISM (PB.1.4, PB.1.5) annotated to the same transcript (shaded orange), the longest ISMs (PB.1.5) takes precedence and counts from respective ISM are similarly aggregated 
			\item there are multiple FSM (PB.1.6, PB.1.7) annotated to the same transcript (shaded purple), the longest FSM (PB.1.7) takes precedence and counts are similarly aggregated

\subsection{Differential analysis}
Iso-Seq and aligned RNA-Seq read counts were analysed for differential expression using \textit{tappAS} (described in \cref{ch3_tappas_explained}). Briefly, \textit{tappAS} filters out lowly-expressed isoforms, normalises read counts using TMM approach and performs differential expression analysis using \textit{maSigPro}\cite{Conesa2006,Nueda2014,Conesa2017} to elucidate effects for both genotype and age with the following adapted model\cite{Conesa2006}: 

\vspace{1cm}
\begin{myequation}[h]
Let \textit{I} denote the genotype groups (wild-type - WT, transgenic - TG) and \textit{J} as the age (2 and 8 months) for each particular group, and assuming that gene or transcript expression in measured in replicated samples (\textit{R}).  
\begin{align}
	y_{ijr} =  \:&\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}D_{ijr} \nonumber
	\\ &+ \delta_{0}T_{ijr} + \delta_{1}T_{ijr}D_{ijr}   \nonumber
\end{align}
where
\begin{conditions*}
	y_{ijr} & normalised expression value for each gene or transcript in the situation \textit{ijr} (genotype group \textit{i} at age \textit{j} of replicate \textit{r}) \\
	D  &  dummy binary variable to distinguish between the genotype groups, whereby 0 refers to reference group (WT) and 1 refers to experimental group (TG) \\
	T  &  age at 2 8 months described using a polynomial model with a degree of 1 \\
	\beta_{0}, \delta_{0}, \gamma_{0}, \lambda _{0} & regression coefficients for reference group (WT) relating to the age \\ 
	\beta_{1}, \delta_{1}, \gamma_{1}, \lambda _{1} & regression coefficients for the difference between the experimental group (TG) and reference group (WT) at each age  
\end{conditions*}
therefore, if:
\begin{conditions*}
	FDR(\beta_{1}) < 0.05 & significant expression difference between WT and TG at 2 months \\ 
	FDR(\delta_{0}) < 0.05 & significant expression difference in WT across 2 and 8 months \\
\end{conditions*}

	The regression coefficients from Equation \ref{eq:dea_lm_masigpro} - $\beta_{1}$, $\delta_{0}$, $\delta_{1}$ - refer to the different variables modelled, the significance of which can be used to infer whether there is a genotype, age or interaction effect. The significance is symbolised by the tick and cross, which refers to adjusted P-value (FDR) < 0.05 and > 0.05 respectively. A significance of  $\beta_{1}$ denotes to a statistically significant difference between WT and TG at T1 (Genotype effect),$\delta_{0}$ to a difference in WT over time (Age effect), and $\delta_{1}$ to a difference between WT and TG across age (Interaction effect).}

Under this model, a differentially expressed gene or transcript between WT and TG mice was defined with a statistically significant coefficient (adjusted P-value < 0.05) and a regression model with R\textsuperscript{2} > 0.5  (\cref{fig:dea_model}) .

\section{Results}
\subsection{PacBio Iso-Seq run performance and sequencing metrics}
No significant difference in sequencing run yield was identified between WT and TG (n = 12 animals, two-tailed unpaired t-test, t(10) = -0.636, P = 0.539, \cref{ig:rTg4510_sequencing_metrics}\textbf{A}), and no significant correlation was observed between run yield and RIN across samples (n = 12 animals, Pearson's correlation, t = -0.98, df = 10, P = 0.350, \cref{ig:rTg4510_sequencing_metrics}\textbf{B}). No difference was observed in the number of reads (\cref{fig:rTg4510_sequencing_metrics}\textbf{C}) and transcripts generated between WT and TG (n = 12, two-tailed unpaired t-test, t = -0.005, df = 10, P = 0.996, \cref{fig:rTg4510_sequencing_metrics}\textbf{E}) or by age (n = 12, t = -1.58, df = 10, P = 0.15). ERCC alignment and annotations similarly revealed no difference in number of ERCC detected between WT and TG (mean number of ERCC: WT = 32.4 (35\%), TG = 32.2 (35.22\%)).

\subsection{Change in endogenous expression}
%Check whether overexpression of human MAPT result in any unwanted, compensatory effects on equivalent mouse genes,as expression levels of mouse APP and MAPT should be slightly reduced, thereby suggesting no evidence that human transgene expression increase expression of directly-related mouse genes.
As expected, human-specific \textit{MAPT} sequences were only detected in reads from TG mice, confirming stable activation of human \textit{MAPT} transgene (\cref{fig:isoseq_humanmapt}\textbf{A}) and supporting findings from Castanho et al.\cite{Castanho2020}. Alignment of these human-specific transcripts to the mouse genome were mapped either to the mouse prion protein gene (\textit{Prnp}) with high identity but short overlap (\cref{fig:isoseq_humanmapt}\textbf{b,c}), given that the transgene contains exons 2-3 of mouse \textit{Prnp}\cite{Ramsden2005}, and to the mouse \textit{Mapt} gene with low identity but long overlap (\cref{fig:isoseq_humanmapt}\textbf{b,d}). Applying filter thresholds for downstream analysis removed these human-specific \textit{MAPT} transcripts (\cref{fig:isoseq_humanmapt}\textbf{B}).

\subsection{Transcriptome Annotation of rTg4510 mice}
While identifying widespread RNA isoform diversity amongst genes expressed in the mouse entorhinal cortex (described in \cref{ch: whole_transcriptome}), no difference was observed in the number of genes (mean number = 13,302 genes) or isoforms (mean number = 35,157 isoforms) detected between wild-type and transgenic mouse aged 2 and 8 months. Further characterisation of the transcriptome revealed similar profile of isoform diversity between the two genotypes and ages (\cref{tab:isoseq_whole_subsqantioutput}), with half of the isoforms annotated as known (mean number = 18,567 isoforms (52.8\%), as also shown in \cref{sec:whole_novelIso}) and with a similar distribution in isoform length and number of exons (median: 9, range = 1-89).

\subsection{rTg4510 mice display similar global AS patterns}
Transcriptome profiling of the mouse cortex previously identified widespread isoform diversity, driven predominantly by the usage of alternative first exons (AF) and exon skipping (ES) (described in \cref{sec:whole_novelIso}). Upon further examination, there was no significant difference in splicing patterns associated with rTg510 pathology or across age with AF (mean n = 20,400, 40.2\%) as the most prevalent event across all datasets \cref{AS_WholeTranscriptome_diff}.

\subsection{rTg4510-associated isoforms enriched for 3'UTR motif}
We next investigated whether the inclusion of the specific functional elements differed between wild-type and transgenic mice, suggesting a disease-specific regulation. Features characterised with DFI were observed across all functional categories (\cref{fig:DFI}\textbf{A}), with significant enrichment for 3'UTR motif (Fisher's Exact Test (FET) P = 1.51 x 10\textsuperscript{-4}), post-transcriptional,  modifications (PTM, FET P = 7.36 x 10\textsuperscript{-152}) and protein-binding sites (FET P = 6.13 x 10\textsuperscript{-17}. For transcript features, we observed that feature gain (i.e. feature is upregulated or favoured) was more apparent in in Wild-type whereas the the protein features, with the exception of transmembranes, were more frequent in the transgenic (\cref{fig:DFI}\textbf{B}).

\subsection{Iso-Seq confirms widespread gene expression differences associated with tau pathology in rTg4510 mice}
%\boldheader{Usage of Iso-Seq reads alone detected robust changes in gene expression}
While Iso-Seq reads are commonly used for accurately characterising RNA diversity, we found that Iso-Seq reads were also able to accurately quantify the abundance of highly-expressed transcripts - as illustrated by the strong correlation of gene-level expression quantified using Iso-Seq and RNA-Seq reads, and near-perfect correlation Iso-Seq reads and actual amount of ERCC controls (described in XX). Strikingly, despite the lower long-read sequencing coverage and smaller sample size (n = 6 TG, n = 6 WT) sequenced on the long-read platform, a significant number of genes (n = 446 genes) were identified as differentially expressed when we used the Iso-Seq long reads for both annotation and expression. Using \textit{EnrichR}, differentially expressed genes (n = 466) were found to be highly enriched in lysosome (KEGG 2021 Human: odds ratio = 5.99, adjusted P = 4.41 x 10\textsuperscript{-6}) and in particularly the TGF-\textbeta pathway (WikiPathway 2021 Human: odds ratio = 58.98, adjusted P = 2.69 x 10\textsuperscript{-3} ). Classification of the differentially expressed genes by effects (n = 448 genes, depicted in \cref{fig:dea_model}\textbf{A} and showcased in \cref{fig:dea_model_genexp}), further identified the majority (n = 372 genes, \cref{fig:dea_model_num}\textbf{A}) to be associated with tau pathology (n = 55, \cref{fig:dea_model_genexp}\textbf{a, b}) and progressive with age (n = 317, \cref{fig:dea_model_genexp}\textbf{d,e,f,g}). Further examination of these genes revealed enrichment in the "turquoise" co-expression module (n = 134 genes, 36\%) identified from previous WGCNA analyses, which was previously found to become increasing upregulated with development of tau pathology and was highly enriched in pathways involved in immune system activation\cite{Castanho2020} (\cref{fig:dea_model_num}\textbf{B}).

Usage of Iso-Seq reads alone identified differentially-expressed genes previously reported to be highly associated with AD. The top ranked tau-associated differentially-expressed genes that was found to be progressive with age in our previous analyse\cite{Castanho2020} was also recapitulated (\cref{fig:whole_dea}\textbf{a,b}): \textit{Gfap}, which encodes for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP\nomenclature{GFAP}{Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein}), a cytoskeletal protein that acts as a marker for astrocyte activation and proliferation - its increased expression was reported to correlate with increased neurofibrillary tangles density in Alzheimer's disease entorhinal cortex tissues \cite{Muramori1998}. Higher GFAP levels have also be documented in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in patients with AD compared to healthy control \cite{Ishiki2016}, and more recently, in plasma of cognitively intact older adults at risk of AD \cite{Chatterjee2021}.

Other top-ranked differentially-expressed genes have been reported to be involved in AD development and pathology, notably \textit{C4b} - a member of the complement immune system (\cref{fig:whole_dea}\textbf{c,d}), \textit{Slc14a1} encoding the urea transporter 1, \textit{Tgfbr1} encoding the TGF-\textbeta receptor protein (\cref{fig:whole_dea}\textbf{e,f}) and \textit{Unc93b1}, a transmembrane protein required for toll (\cref{tab:dea_wholemouse}). Up-regulated expression of these genes have been observed previously in AD patients and other AD mouse models \cite{Zorzetto2016,Castillo2017,Wirz2013}.

\subsection{rTg4510 mice characterised by expression differences in novel, antisense genes}
Our group previously characterised widespread transcriptional differences in rTg4510 entorhinal cortex, identifying extensive differences in gene expression associated with development of tau pathology in TG mice (n = 154 differentially expressed genes)\cite{Castanho2020}. Mapping the same RNA-Seq reads (n = 29 TG, n = 30 WT) to Iso-Seq reads (n = 6 TG, n = 6 WT) derived from the same animals rather to the reference genome annotation, we similarly identify extensive differences in gene expression (n = XX differentially expressed genes) with a large overlap. 

The hybrid approach also enabled identification of tau-pathology associated changes in genes not previously known in reference. Using the Iso-Seq reads as annotation and RNA-Seq reads for expression, we identified robust expression changes in a few genes (n = 3) that we would have otherwise not detected if we used the reference genome for annotation. These "novel" genes, not present in existing genome annotations (mm10), have been previously characterised as more lowly-expressed and often were antisense to known genes, with a large proportion sharing exonic regions either at the 5'UTR, 3'UTR or within the gene body (\cref{sec:whole_novelgenes}). The most significant differentially-expressed novel gene was identified in Chromosome 10 (\cref{fig:whole_novelgene_difftracks}\textbf{A}), with progressive down-regulation in TG over time (\cref{fig:whole_novelgene_diffexp}\textbf{A}). The other differentially-expressed novel genes were found antisense to \textit{Fgfr1op} (\cref{fig:whole_novelgene_difftracks}\textbf{B}), within the gene-body, and to \textit{Htra1}  (\cref{fig:whole_novelgene_difftracks}\textbf{C}), at the 5'UTR. Both genes were associated with increased expression in TG compared to the WT over time (\cref{fig:whole_novelgene_diffexp}\textbf{b,d}). Notably, while \textit{Fgfr1op} was not identified as differentially-expressed (\cref{fig:whole_novelgene_diffexp}\textbf{C}), \textit{Htra1} was also found to have higher expression in TG compared to WT (\cref{fig:whole_novelgene_diffexp}\textbf{E}).

\subsection{rTg4510 characterised by widespread expression changes in transcripts associated to genes implicated in AD}
One of the added advantages of long reads over short-reads is the power to accurately identify isoforms and to explore isoform expression changes across conditions and over time. Using \textit{MaSigPro} with Iso-Seq reads as both reference annotation and expression, we identified hundreds of differentially expressed isoforms (n = 582 isoforms), of which 36 isoforms (6.19\%) were associated with rTg4510 genotype, and 378 isoforms (64.9\%) associated with progressive tau pathology. 

Other isoforms that were significantly unregulated with progressive tau pathology were annotated to genes that have been previously strongly implicated in AD pathology and development (\cref{fig:DEI_ADgenes_isoseq}). This included ENSMUST00000151120.8 associated with \textit{Ctsd}, which encodes for Cathepsin D, a lysosomal protease that is involved in degradation of A$\beta$ \cite{JR1996}, tau \cite{A1997}, and has recently been identified as a key regulator of A$\beta$42/40 ratio \cite{Suire2020}. Other isoforms include ENSMUST00000172785.7 associated with \textit{H2-D1} - that encodes for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class 1, an immune-related gene that has been found to be upregulated in microglial cells of a different mouse model of neurodegeneration with AD-like phenotypes \cite{Mathys2017} - ENSMUST00000028624.8 associated with \textit{Gatm}, a mitochondrial protein that has been recently revealed as a key protein signature of AD from a large proteomic analysis of human cortex and CSF \cite{Wang2020}, - and ENSMUST00000030765.6 associated with \textit{Padi2}/\textit{Pad2}, an enzyme that has been found abnormally activated in astrocytes of patients with AD \cite{A2005}.

%\boldheader{Iso-Seq reads can accurately quantify highly-expressed isoforms and identify significant expression changes in isoforms annotated to highly-expressed genes}
Observations of differential isoform expression using Iso-Seq reads as expression were recapitulated with RNA-Seq reads, highlighting the power to accurately quantify isoforms at high expression (\cref{fig:DEI_ADgenes_rnaseq}).
However, on closer examination, the majority of isoforms identified as differentially expressed with progressive tau pathology (n = 321, 84.9\%) were not similarly identified as differentially expressed when RNA-Seq reads were used as expression. Given that the wide majority of Iso-Seq-identified-differentially-expressed isoforms were very-lowly expressed (295 isoforms,91.9\%, with mean full-length counts < 24 FL, n = 12 samples) with low read count, a seemingly significant expression change may result in calling the isoform differentially expressed (\cref{fig:dei_lowisoexp}). However, even for more highly-expressed isoforms, while a change in mean expression was observed, the variance was substantial due to a small sample size (n = 3 replicates). Conversely, with a greater sample size (n = 6 replicates) and higher sequencing coverage of RNA-Seq reads, the usage of RNA-Seq reads as expression reduced the probability of calling an isoform as differentially expressed due to chance (\cref{fig:dei_highisoexp}).      

\subsection{Gene expression differences in rTg4510 are primarily driven by differential expression of dominant isoform}
%\boldheader{Robust changes in isoform expression associated with progressive tau pathology were identified with Iso-Seq annotation and expression}
Strikingly, the two most significant progressive-tau-associated differentially expressed isoforms were annotated to \textit{Gfap} (\cref{fig:DEI_gfap}) and \textit{C4b} (\cref{fig:DEI_c4b}), the top two most differentially-expressed genes (\cref{tab:dea_wholemouse}). Both genes were characterised by a dominant known isoform in rTg4510 mice, which was significantly up-regulated with progressive tau pathology (\cref{fig:DEI_gfap}\textbf{A}, \cref{fig:DEI_c4b}\textbf{A}), indicating that increased \textit{Gfap} (\cref{fig:whole_dea}\textbf{A}) and \textit{C4b} (\cref{fig:whole_dea}\textbf{C}) gene expression in rTg4510 mice were primarily driven by one associated isoform. Notably, expression of other minor novel isoforms was also higher in rTg4510 mice aged 8 months (\cref{fig:DEI_gfap}\textbf{B}, \cref{fig:DEI_c4b}\textbf{B}). A similar finding was also observed when using RNA-Seq reads as abundance, though tau-pathology associated expression changes in minor isoforms were significantly more pronounced - a reflection of the comparably higher sequencing coverage of RNA-Seq reads to Iso-Seq reads.

\subsection{Iso-Seq read depth from global transcriptome profiling insufficient for differential transcript usage analysis}
Contributing to the complexity of transcript regulation through alternative splicing, while the expression of a gene may be constant between conditions, the relative expression of the isoforms (and thus isoform proportion) can change. This phenomenon is known as differential transcript/isoform usage (DIU), and was also assessed using \textit{tappAS} for genes with more than one isoform. Of note, a major isoform switching event occurs when the dominant (major) isoform in one condition becomes a minor isoform in another.    

Using Iso-Seq reads for annotation and expression and after filtering lowly-expressed isoforms, we identified 400 genes that were characterised with differential isoform usage. However upon further examination, the majority of these genes were lowly expressed and the associated isoforms that were observed to undergo differential usage had only 1-2 full-length long-read counts. We were therefore not confident in any of observed DIU changes detected with Iso-Seq abundance from the whole transcriptome sequencing due to low sequencing depth. Indeed, none of the DTU genes were significant after applying a gene expression threshold (described in \cref{ch:diu_method}).

% DIU genes with major switching	
In further support of this conclusion, there was a low overlap of DIU genes that were identified when we used RNA-Seq reads as expression. This was likely to be a reflection of lower sequencing depth of Iso-Seq reads, resulting in i) a different pool of isoforms after filtering lowly-expressed isoforms - a minor isoform was more likely to be filtered when using RNA-Seq reads as abundance rather than Iso-Seq reads, particularly if the overall gene expression was low, due to relatively greater expression difference, and ii) smaller differences in isoform expression using Iso-Seq reads are translated to misleading significant changes in isoform proportions, resulting in false detection of genes as DIU. These implications can be seen in the gene \textit{Esyt2}, whereby the low Iso-Seq isoform counts resulted in misleading representation of isoform fraction, which was not recapitulated when RNA-Seq reads were used as expression (\cref{fig:DIU_esyt2}). 

\begin{figure}[htp]

Iso-Seq reads were used as annotation in both analyses. 
		\\
		As can be observed, the Iso-Seq normalised counts are significantly lower than RNA-Seq normalised counts for the associated isoforms, resulting in a misleading representation of isoform fraction with major isoform switching events (Figure c, PB.3907.1 becomes the dominant isoform in transgenic mice), which is not recapitulated with RNA-Seq reads as expression (Figure d)}

\subsection{Hybrid approach identifies tau-pathology associated differential isoform usage with major isoform switching events}
Differential isoform usage was performed with Iso-Seq reads as annotation and RNA-Seq reads as expression, given higher sequencing RNA-Seq read depth and greater sample size. 570 genes were identified with differential isoform usage (\cref{tab:DIU_DEA_nums}).

The majority of these genes (n = 498, 87.3\%), while observed with DIU, were not differentially expressed between wild-type and transgenic mice - a scenario whereby the differential upregulation of one isoform is compensated by the differential downregulation of another isoform, resulting in no net gene expression change. This indicates that a significant degree of the post-transcriptional regulation was independent of gene expression regulation. An example of this was \textit{Ptprz1}, a receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase, which is involved in oligodendrocyte development and function. While there was no change in overall gene expression, closer examination revealed progressive upregulation of two isoforms (PB.13000,10, PB.13000.11) which was offset by progressive downregulation of two other isoforms (PB.13000.14, PB.13000.7) in transgenic mice. In transgenic mice, the known isoform PB.13000.10 (ENSMUST00000090568.6) continued to dominate in both wild-type and transgenic mice across all ages with a slight increase. This was complemented by a slight decrease in the another known shorter isoform PB.13000.14 (ENSMUST00000202579.3). Interestingly, the two other differentially expressed isoforms were novel, with skipping of exon 16. 

The most significant gene characterised with differential isoform usage with a dominant isoform switch but no change in gene expression was \textit{Cisd3}, a mitochondrial iron-sulphur domain-containing protein involved in regulating electron transport and iron homeostasis essential for normal mitochondrial function. While there was little change in overall gene expression, there is a major isoform shift between wild-type and transgenic mice that was generally consistent across all ages. The two isoforms only differ at the 5'end with the first exon of the upregulated isoform, ENSMUST00000107583.2 (PB.2833.2), spanning across exons 1 and 2 of the downregulated isoform, ENSMUST00000107584.7 (PB.2833.1).

\subsection{Integrative analysis reveals co-localisation of genotype-associated differentially expressed transcripts and differentially-methylated positions}
Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation have been widely acknowledged to heavily influence gene regulation and more specifically, alternative splicing. Using genome-wide DNA methylation data on the same mouse samples, we wanted to use an integrative approach to identify genes with both splicing and methylation changes between wild-type and transgenic mice. Genes defined to undergo differential splicing were classified by either genes with a change in transcript expression (differential isoform expression - DIE), a change in usage of isoform proportions (differential isoform usage - DIU) or a change in feature element (differential feature inclusion - DFI). Genes with changes in methylation were classified as either with a change in a specific position (differential methylated position - DMP) associated with tau pathology (genotype effect) and progressively over time (interaction effect), or associated with a cluster of differentially methylated cytosines (differentially methylated region - DMR). 

Using a stringent approach to identify biologically meaningful splicing changes, we identified nine genes with an altered splicing and methylation profile associated with progressive tau pathology. The most significant co-differentially-methylated position and differentially-spliced gene was \textit{Spata13} - a gene involved in cell migration\cite{Bourbia2019} and has been reported to be upregulated in entorhinal cortex of AD patients\cite{Yan2019} - which was characterised with a change in transcript expression, usage and feature inclusion. There was a significant progressive increase in expression of the shorter known isoform (PB.4966.2, ENSMUST00000162945.1) in the transgenic mice, whereas there was no change in expression of the longer, novel NIC isoform (PB.4966.1) which harboured a 5' miRNA-binding site (miR-446h-5p) and an alternative transcription start site with an upstream open reading frame (\cref{fig:IntMeth_Spata13}\textbf{a, d}). A DMP was identified upstream of \textit{Spata13} (8.9Kb and 107Kb from known and novel isoform respectively, \cref{fig:IntMeth_Spata13}\textbf{b, d}) and was hypermethylated in transgenic mice compared to wild-type ($\Delta$$\beta$ = 0.777, FDR\textsubscript{interaction} = 0.012), \cref{fig:IntMeth_Spata13}\textbf{C}), suggesting a distal suppressed expression of both isoforms in the wild-type. Conversely, the decreased methylation in the transgenic is only associated with suppressed expression of the proximal, novel isoform.

%Another gene with co-differentially-methylated position and differentially-spliced gene was \textit{Tmem237}, characterised by an isoform switch of a known (PB.261.4) and novel NNC (PB.261.10) isoform, which had an alternative first exon and a shorter 3'UTR resulting in absence of miRNA-binding sites.

\newpage
Other genes were characterised with a change in transcript expression correlated with a change in methylation. This included \textit{Ncf2} (\cref{fig:IntMeth_Ncf2}), \textit{Osmr}, and \textit{Cebpa} where there was a progressive increase in expression of the respective known isoform and an associated hypomethylated DMP (located in the promoter) in transgenic; whereas in \textit{Rnf165} and \textit{Susd5} (\cref{fig:IntMeth_Susd5}), there was a progressive downregulation of known isoform and an associated hypermethylated DMP in transgenic. Interestingly, we also identified altered splicing and methylation changes in \textit{Irf8} (\cref{fig:IntMeth_Irf8}) - a transcription factor of the IRF family that is involved in microglial activation in AD\cite{Zeng2017}, where a hypomethylated DMP (located 130kb downstream) in TG was associated with progressive increase in transcript expression. The associations described here between DNA methylation and transcript expression support well-established theories of the relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression, whereby increased methylation at the promoter is associated with decreased gene expression. Of note, only one isoform was detected for each of these genes.  
% Note other example where this was not the case

Focusing on genotype-associated differentially methylated regions, we identified splicing changes annotated to \textit{As3mt}  (\cref{fig:IntMeth_As3mt}) and \textit{Prnp}. Three isoforms were detected for \textit{As3mt}, a schizophrenia-associated GWAS gene, whereby there was a progressive upregulation in the known isoform (PB.8363.2, ENSMUST00000003655.8) in TG (P = 4.98 x 10\textsuperscript{-18}, R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.56) while there was no detected change in expression of the two other novel NNC isoforms, both of which were characterised by a novel splice junction resulting in a novel exon that was absent in the known isoform. A 485bp DMR consisting of nine differentially methylated cytosines was identified \textasciitilde{}8kb upstream of this novel exon within the intron, and was hypermethylated in transgenic mice compared to wild-type ($\Delta$ = 0.19, P = 1.22 x 10\textsuperscript{-8}). We hypothesise that an increase in methylation in this region would hinder recruitment and assembly of the spliceosome, resulting in skipping of the novel exon and subsequent increased expression of the known isoform. 

There was an increase in expression of a novel isoform of \textit{Prnp} in transgenic mice. However, given that \textit{Mapt} transgene includes exons 2 and 3 of the \textit{Prnp}, we were uncertain whether the transcript expression changes attributed to \textit{Prnp} from short-read RNA-Seq reads was due to the mouse gene or the human transgene. No change in transcript expression was identified from Iso-Seq full-length read counts.
