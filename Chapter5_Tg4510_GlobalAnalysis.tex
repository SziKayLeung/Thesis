%%Gene expression and mRNA isoforms vary widely across tissues (\cite{Wang2008}), thus sequencing the disease-relevant tissue (in this case entorhinal cortex) is important for understanding the pathology of AD. However, it is consequently important to note that other tissues may have to be considered to fully grasp the whole picture of AD development. 

\section{Introduction}

Following the accurate characterisation of the mouse transcriptome using long-read sequencing from a global (whole transcriptome approach, \cref{ch: whole_transcriptome}), this chapter aims to exploit these datasets to investigate the transcriptional changes in the mouse entorhinal cortex associated with tau pathology. 

There have been multiple studies recently that explore the transcriptional differences in transgenic mice harbouring different mutations associated with AD. However, all of these studies to date have been undertaken with short-read RNA-Seq - which, while it offers obvious advantage compared to microarrays in accurately quantifying gene expression, is severely limited in detecting and characterising transcripts (as discussed in detail in \cref{rnaseq_intro}). Given that short-reads fail to span the entire length of transcripts, characterising and quantifiying alternatively-spliced isoforms is inferred computationally after alignment by using statistical models, which is computationally challenging - a survey of current tools revealed only 40\% of known human transcripts were assembled \cite{Steijger2013}.  

While there have been significant advances to process long-read sequencing data for transcriptome annotations, methods to harness long-read data for downstream statistical analyses have been limited. These analyses include identifying genes or transcripts with a significant change in expression across biological conditions (the process of which is referred to as Differential Gene Expression, DEG, and Differential Transcript Expression, DTE, analysis respectively), and are typically analysed using statistial tools such as \textit{DESeq}, \textit{edgeR}, \textit{limma}, among others. However, these tools were developed in response to the emergence of short-read RNA-Seq analysis, and typically involve i) aligning short-reads to transcripts either from de-novo assembly or using a reference annotation, and then ii) estimating the transcript expression using complex algorithms. Various benchmarking studies have been conducted to compare the performance of such tools \cite{Teng2016,Rapaport2013}, concluding that there was no single favourable method although tools based on negative binomial modelling (\textit{DESeq}, \textit{edgeR})) had better specificity, sensitivity and good control of false positive errors\cite{Rapaport2013}. 


Currently, all the new tools developed to process long-read sequencing data (such as Oxford Nanopore's recommended cDNA transcriptome tutorial \cite{ONTcdna_transcriptome}, \textit{FLAIR} \cite{Tang2020}) integrate old tools, which were initially designed to analyse short-read sequencing data, for differential gene and isoform analyses. Systematically assessed and benchmarked for detecting differential splicing and expression at isoform level in RNA-Seq studies, \textit{DESeq2}, \textit{DexSeq} and \textit{NOISeq} have been most widely used.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Iso-Seq Processing and Isoform Quantification}
All analyses pertaining to this chapter follows on from \cref{wholetranscriptome} and \cref{targetedmousetranscriptome}: raw Iso-Seq reads from the individual samples were processed using \textit{IsoSeq3}, which were them merged to one complete transcriptome at the global and targeted level, before transcript collapse with \textit{Cupcake}, alignment with \textit{Minimap2}, annotation with \textit{SQANTI3} (v3.3) and finally, additional filtering with \textit{TAMA}. Of note, transcriptome was reannotated with \textit{SQANTI3} due to \text{SQANTI2} being no longer maintained and the addition of novel features in \textit{SQANTI3}, including the generation of a functionally-labelled annotation from the long-reads. 

The full-length long-read counts (abundance) for each sample, required for downstream analyses, were obtained from one of \textit{cupcake's} output files (read\_stat.txt), which documented the source of all the full-length transcripts that were used for isoform collapse. Given that samples were sequenced individually under the whole transcriptome approach, we were thus able to differentiate and count the transcripts using the Run ID. For the targeted transcriptome approach, whereby the samples were barcoded and thus could not be differentiated by sequencing run, we used the ID (original CCS read) documented in the output file (flnc.report.csv) from \textit{Iso-Seq3 Refine} after sample demultiplexing. 


\subsection{Quantification of human MAPT transgene expression} 
As a quality check of sample identity, the presence of human- and mouse-specific Mapt/MAPT sequences was determined in full-length transcripts across all the samples. Species-specific MAPT sequence, located in a 2kb region present in the 3'UTR, was identified after using BLAT\cite{Kent2002} to compare human and mouse MAPT/Mapt sequence for divergent transcript sequences \cite{Castanho2020}).  

\subsection{Characterisation of Alternative Splicing Events} 
Alternative splicing events were examined using a range of packages and custom scripts, as described and implemented in \label{sec:AS_methods}, to assess whether there was a change in splicing patterns associated with rTg4510 pathology and across age. 


\subsection{Differential expression analysis}
After trialling various ad-hoc methods, I chose to explore the transcriptomic changes between wildtype and transgenic mice with \textit{tappAS} (v1.0.0)\cite{DeLaFuente2020}, which was also developed by the same authors as \textit{SQANTI} (A.Conesa's group) and was recommended as an extension to the Iso-Seq pipeline for the functional annotations of isoforms. Accessible as a user-friendly Java application, \textit{tappAS} was chosen as the framework for differential expression analysis due to the flexibility to explore both genotype effects and progressive changes across age, and to optimise parameters as background scripts were fully accessible and clearly written.

\textit{tappAS} requires three inputs\cite{DeLaFuente2020}:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item An experimental design file, which allows comparisons to be made between two or more groups and/or over a time-course 
	\item A transcript-level functional annotation file, which is generated post \textit{SQANTI} using \textit{IsoAnnot} (another tool developed by A.Conesa's group, https://isoannot.tappas.org), as a "scaffold" for transcript-level annotations. For the purpose of this study, the annotation file would be the conglomerate, long-read defined transcriptome of all the samples merged. 
	\item A transcript level expression matrix, which can either be derived directly from the full-length long-read transcript counts, or from mapping and transcript quantification of short-reads to the long-read defined transcriptome using \textit{Kallisto}(v0.46.0). Raw transcript counts were tabulated per sample.  	 
\end{enumerate}

As a method comparison, the expression from both short- and long-read was used as quantification at the gene and transcript level, such that four differential analyses were performed using the whole and targeted transcriptome datasets (\cref{tab:dea_analyses_summary}). To explore the utility and power of long reads for transcriptome annotation, results from the differential gene analyses were also compared to that generated from I.Castanho's analyses \cite{Castanho2020}.

\boldheader{Count Normalisation}
% Discussion of expression 
%The choice to use quantification directly from long-reads or derived indirectly from short-reads is dependent on the read coverage. While there will be no assembly ambiguity in using the abundance counts from long-reads, the coverage from the whole transcriptome approach would be insufficient for meaningful quantitative analyses - as shown in the coverage with ERCC (see Figure \cref{fig:isoseq_whole_ercc}) with lowly-expressed transcripts not being detected. Conversely, this is unlikely to be a limiting factor for the targeted transcriptome approach given the saturation coverage of target genes with additional sequencing of off-target, highly-expressed genes (see Figure \cref{fig:isoseq_targeted_rate}). Consequently, the expression matrix input for the whole transcriptome analyses was derived from the short-read alignment, and from the long-read abundance for the targeted transcriptome analyses. 
Very lowly-expressed transcripts with a sum of expression value less than 1 CPM (counts per million\nomenclature{CPM}{Counts per million}) or a large variance (>100 Coefficient of Variation) across all the samples were removed to reduce noise. The raw transcript counts were then normalised using TMM normalisation \cite{Robinson2010} (Trimmed Mean of M-values\nomenclature{TMM}{Trimmed Mean of M-values}) to account for differences in library size (sequencing depth) and sample RNA library composition, which is particularly important when comparing samples from different genotypes. The difference in RNA composition is determined by calculating a "scaling factor" for each sample relative to a reference sample (sample with the least varying read counts), which is the weighted average of all the log2 ratio of transcript counts between the two samples (M-values). The weighted average does not consider log2 ratio of transcripts with significant differences ("biased" transcripts that are widely present in one sample and not the other, and vice versa) and of transcripts with highest or lowest expression, hence "trimmed mean", to avoid effect of outliers. Of note, TMM assumes that the majority of the transcripts are not differentially expressed. Gene abundance was deduced from the sum of normalised counts of associated isoforms, after removing transcripts with low or highly-varied expression values.     

\boldheader{Differential Gene and Isoform Expression Analysis}
To elucidate transcriptional changes for both genotype and longitudinal effects between two groups and over time, \textit{maSigPro} \cite{Conesa2006,Nueda2014,Conesa2017} was used for both differential gene and transcript expression analysis, implemented as part of \textit{tappAS}. Briefly, maSigPro performs a two-step regression strategy to first define a negative binomial general linearised models\cite{Nueda2014} for each gene or transcript, accounting for both genotype and age (Equation \cref{eq:dea_lm_masigpro}), and identify differentially expressed genes. A stepwise regression is then applied to identify the conditions for which the differentially expressed genes have statistically significant profiles.  

Adapting the model\cite{Conesa2006} to our scenario, let \textit{I} denote the genotype groups (wildtype - WT, transgenic - TG) and \textit{J} as the age (2, 4, 6, 8 months) for each particular group, and assuming that gene or transcript expression in measured in replicated samples (\textit{R}).  

\begin{myequation}[!h]
\begin{align}\label{eq:dea_lm_masigpro}
y_{ijr} =  \:&\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}D_{ijr} \nonumber
\\ &+ \delta_{0}T_{ijr} + \delta_{1}T_{ijr}D_{ijr}   \nonumber
\\ &+ \gamma_{0}T_{1ijr}^{2} + \gamma_{1}T_{ijr}^{2}D_{ijr} \nonumber
\\ &+ \lambda _{0}T_{ijr}^{3} + \lambda_{1}T_{ijr}^{3}D_{ijr} + \varepsilon_{ijr} \nonumber
\end{align}
where:
\begin{conditions*}
	y_{ijr} & normalised expression value for each gene or transcript in the situation \textit{ijr} (genotype group \textit{i} at age \textit{j} of replicate \textit{r}) \\
	D  &  dummy binary variable to distinguish between the genotype groups, whereby 0 refers to reference group (WT) and 1 refers to experimental group (TG) \\
	T  &  age at 2, 4, 6, 8 months described using a polynomial model with a degree of 3 \\
	\beta_{0}, \delta_{0}, \gamma_{0}, \lambda _{0} & regression coefficients for reference group (WT) relating to the age \\ 
	\beta_{1}, \delta_{1}, \gamma_{1}, \lambda _{1} & regression coefficients for the difference between the experimental group (TG) and reference group (WT) at each age  
\end{conditions*}
therefore, if:
\begin{conditions*}
	FDR(\beta_{1}) < 0.05 & significant expression difference between WT and TG at 2 months \\ 
	FDR(\delta_{0}) < 0.05 & significant expression difference in WT across 2 and 4 months \\
	FDR(\delta_{1}) < 0.05 & significant expression difference between WT and TG across 2 and 4 months \\
\end{conditions*}

The regression coefficients from Equation \cref{eq:dea_lm_masigpro} - $\beta_{1}$, $\delta_{0}$, $\delta_{1}$ - refer to the different variables modelled, the significance of which can be used to infer whether there is a genotype, age or interaction effect. The significance is symbolised by the tick and cross, which refers to adjusted P-value (FDR) < 0.05 and > 0.05 respectively. A significance of  $\beta_{1}$ denotes to a statistically significant difference between WT and TG at T1 (Genotype effect),$\delta_{0}$ to a difference in WT over time (Age effect), and $\delta_{1}$ to a difference between WT and TG across age (Interaction effect). \\\\
	\textit{maSigPro} labels the coefficients in the results table as "CaseVsControl", "Time", "TimexCase" for $\beta_{1}$, $\delta_{0}$, $\delta_{1}$. In the case where there is more time points/ages (as experimented in the Targeted Transcriptome datasets), the significance for the additional regression coefficients relating to the additional time variables are reported (Time2, Time2xCase, Time3, Time3xCase)}   
	\label{fig:dea_model}
\end{figure}

A gene or transcript with different profiles between WT and TG mice would have a different corresponding regression model with a statistically significant coefficient (\cref{fig:dea_model}), and was considered differentially expressed if P-value adjusted for multiple testing, by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR\nomenclature{FDR}{False Discovery Rate}) with the Benjamin and Hochberg correction, was < 0.05 and R\textsuperscript{2} > 0.5. The R\textsuperscript{2} defines the proportion of deviance that was explained by the linear regression model ("goodness of fit"), whereby a recommended threshold of 0.5 was used to identify differentially expressed genes with meaningful biological implications \cite{Conesa2006}.

Following the identification of statistically significant gene models (\cref{fig:dea_model}), the specific conditions (phenotype or age-associated changes) for which the genes show statistically significant profile changes (the significant variables) were identified by using an iterative backward stepwise approach \cite{Conesa2017}. The procedure therefore first started with all the variables imputed (different phenotype x age at different time points). At each iteration step, the P-value associated to each variable was determined and only the variables with a P-value < 0.05 were retained. 

\boldheader{Differential Isoform Usage}
\label{ch:diu_method}
In addition to assessing expression changes across conditions through differential isoform expression analysis, the relative expression, and as such the usage, of these isoforms can also change (see \cref{intro:dtu}). A gene is therefore identified as exhibiting differential isoform usage (DIU) if the fraction of the associated isoforms (Isoform Fraction) is significantly altered between conditions, which could result in detection of a different dominant isoform. This phenomenon is known as major isoform switching, when the same isoform in predominantly expressed in one condition (major isoform) but lowly expressed in another (minor isoform). 

In accounting for biological replicates, the isoform fraction (IF) for each isoform was defined as:

\begin{myequation}[!h]
	\begin{align}
	IF_{cig} = \frac{\bar{E}_{cig}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\bar{E}_{cig}}
	\end{align}
	where:
	\begin{conditions*}
		\hspace{3mm}\conj{E}\textsubscript{cig} & mean normalised expression for isoform \textit{i} associated to gene \textit{g} under condition \textit{c}\\
		\hspace{3mm}n  & total number of isoforms associated with gene \textit{g}
	\end{conditions*}
	\captionsetup{width=0.95\textwidth}
	\caption[Calculation of isoform fraction for differential isoform usage analysis]%
	{\textbf{Calculation of isoform fraction for differential isoform usage analysis}. Equation is adopted from \textit{tappAS}}    
\end{myequation}

% Need more information from paper on how DIU was performed
Identification of genes with DIU was performed with \textit{Iso-maSigPro}\cite{Nueda2018}, similarly implemented as part of \textit{tappAS}. Results from differential gene expression and differential isoform usage can be further combined to explore the transcriptomic changes associated with progressive tau pathology (depicted in \cref{fig:DIU_DEA_model}).  

Despite abundant evidence of widespread isoform diversity \cite{Wang2008}, most protein-coding genes have been reported to typically express a few dominant isoforms \cite{Gonzalez-Porta2013, Ezkurdia2015}, while the remaining are very lowly expressed and unlikely to be main contributors to the proteome \cite{Gonzalez-Porta2013}.As such, minor isoforms were filtered to avoid finding genes associated with differential isoform usage due to "flat" behaviour of these minor isoforms \cite{DeLaFuente2020} (relatively small non-negligible expression changes of minor isoforms in the opposing direction of the predominant isoforms). \textit{tappAS} provides two strategies to filter lowly-expressed isoforms: an isoform is only retained if its proportion relative to other isoforms is greater than the pre-specified threshold (default: proportion $>$ 10\%) in at least one sample, or alternatively if its proportion relative to the major isoform is below a pre-specified threshold (default: FC = 2). A major isoform is defined as the isoform with the highest expression across all the conditions, with the remaining isoforms annotated as minor. 

Implemented as an additional filtering step after \textit{tappAS} and recommended in other bioinformatic tools\cite{Vitting-Seerup2017}, lowly expressed genes were also filtered as there would be less confidence in isoform fraction used for determining genes with significant differential isoform usage.

Conversely, a gene may not be differentially expressed, due to averaging of isoform expression, but is characterised with differential isoform usage between the two conditions (Conditions 3 and 4)}

\section{Results}

\subsection{Change in endogeneous expression}
%Check whether overexpression of human MAPT result in any unwanted, compensatory effects on equivalent mouse genes,as expression levels of mouse APP and MAPT should be slightly reduced, thereby suggesting no evidence that human transgene expression increase expression of directly-related mouse genes.
As expected, human-specific \textit{MAPT} sequences were only detected in reads from TG mice, confirming stable activation of human \textit{MAPT} transgene (\cref{fig:isoseq_humanmapt}\textbf{a}) and supporting findings from Castanho et al.\cite{Castanho2020}. Alignment of these human-specific transcripts to the mouse genome were mapped either to the mouse prion protein gene (\textit{Prnp}) with high identity but short overlap (\cref{fig:isoseq_humanmapt}\textbf{b,c}), given that the transgene contains exons 2-3 of mouse \textit{Prnp}\cite{Ramsden2005}, and to the mouse \textit{Mapt} gene with low identity but long overlap (\cref{fig:isoseq_humanmapt}\textbf{b,d}). Applying filter thresholds for downstream analysis removed these human-specific \textit{MAPT} transcripts (\cref{fig:isoseq_humanmapt}\textbf{b}).

\subsection{Transcriptome Annotation}
%No difference was observed in the number of transcripts generated between WT and TG (n = 12, two-tailed unpaired t-test, t = -0.005, df = 10, P = 0.996) or by age (n = 12, t = -1.58, df = 10, P = 0.15).
While identifying widespread RNA isoform diversity amongst genes expressed in the mouse entorhinal cortex (described in \cref{wholetranscriptome}), no difference was observed in the number of genes (mean number = 13,302 genes) or isoforms (mean number = 35,157 isoforms) detected between wildtype and trangenic mouse at the two ages (WT: n = 6, TG: n = 6). Further characterisation of the transcriptome revealed similar profile of isoform diversity between the two phenotypes and ages (\cref{tab:isoseq_whole_subsqantioutput}), with half of the isoforms annotated as known (mean number = 18,567 isoforms (52.8\%), as also shown in \cref{sec:whole_novelIso}) and with a similar distribution in isoform length and number of exons (median: 9, range = 1-89)

\subsection{Alternative Splicing and Functional Diversity}
Transcriptome profiling of the mouse cortex previously identified widespread isoform diversity, driven predominantly by the usage of alternative first exons (AF) and exon skipping (ES) (described in \cref{sec:whole_novelIso}). Upon further examination, there was no significant difference in splicing patterns associated with rTg510 pathology or across age with AF (mean n = 20,400, 40.2\%) as the most prevalent event across all datasets \cref{AS_WholeTranscriptome_diff}. 
%stats?
%XX of known transcripts were identified to have intron retention; XX of known transcripts were identified to be fusion genes. XX of know transcripts identified to have non-sense-mediated decay.

However, aside from changes in splicing patterns, variations in strutural and feature elements annotated across RNA and protein isoforms of the same gene can also have functional implications \cite{DeLaFuente2020}. Using \textit{TappAS}\cite{DeLaFuente2020}, we qualitiatively catalogued the functional diversity of all multi-isoform genes, performing pairwise comparisons between isoforms of the same gene to test for either the i) presence or absence of the annotated feature or ii) in the annotated genomic positions (a feature is classified as varying if the feature's coordinates differ by >9bp between isoforms of the same gene). Of note, many of the protein-defined features can be explored using both approaches given that these elements can be affected through complete skipping (resulting in absence) or partial disruption (resulting in varied genomic position).

Under these two approaches, we identifed that the majority of genes had elements that varied either by absence/presence or by position (\cref{fig:FDA_whole}\textbf{a}). Among elements at a transcript level, miRNA binding had the highest rate of varying (n = 4209 genes) with a large number of miRNA sites varying at the 3'UTR (n = 431). Top miRNAs included miR-207 (P = 0.0003, Adjusted P = 0.07, Varying n = 163 genes), which transfected expression in astrocytes was found to allieviate symptoms of depression in stressed mice\cite{Li2020}, and miR-335-3p (P = 0.0015, Adjusted P = 0.1992, Varying n = 167 genes), which was found enriched in aged cultured astrocytes and hippocampal brains\cite{Raihan2018}, while downgregulated in PD patients versus controls\cite{Oliveira2020}. 
%nonsense-mediated decay had no variation
Regarding protein-level features, PFAM domains had the highest rate of varying (55\%), with cytochrome P450 as the top most varying PFAM domain (n = 10 genes, P = 0.002) and protein kinase domain as the domain with most varied number of genes (n = 126 genes, P = 0.0095). GO analysis of these genes where protein kinase domain varied across isoforms identified signicant enrichment for the MAPK (Odds ratio = 21.06, Adjusted P = 5.45 x 10\textsuperscript{-23}) and Neurotrophin signalling pathway (Odds ratio = 40.36, Adjusted P = 6.711 x 10\textsuperscript{-23}). 

Poly A site had the highest rate of varying by position among transcript-level features (90.2\% across 7,647 genes), followed by coding squence (80.3\% across 6,812 genes). Furthermore, the vast majority of UTR-varying genes also exhibited CDS variation (\cref{fig:FDA_whole}\textbf{c}). This included \textit{Celf2} (\cref{fig:Celf}), which was identified as exibiting varying lengths of 5'UTR, 3'UTR and polyA in combination with varying miRNA binding sites. The top PFAM domain by position was Ras family (P = 0.0001, Adjustd P = 0.38, Varying n = 58 genes).

\subsection{Differential Gene Expression Analysis}
Our group previously characterised widespread transcriptional differences in rTg4510 entorinhal cortex, identifying extensive differences in gene expression associated with development of tau pathology in TG mice (n = 154 differentaially expressed genes)\cite{Castanho2020}. Mapping the same RNA-Seq reads (n = 29 TG, n = 30 WT) to Iso-Seq reads (n = 6 TG, n = 6 WT) derived from the same animals rather to the reference genome annotation, we similarly identify extensive differences in gene expression (n = XX differentially expressed genes) with a large overlap. 

The hybrid approach also enabled identification of tau-pathology associated changes in genes not previously known in reference. Using the Iso-Seq reads as annotation and RNA-Seq reads for expression, we identified robust expression changes in a few genes (n = 3) that we would have otherwise not detected if we used the reference genome for annotation. These "novel" genes, not present in existing genome annotations (mm10), have been previously characterised as more lowly-expressed and often were antisense to known genes, with a large proportion sharing exonic regions either at the 5'UTR, 3'UTR or within the gene body (\cref{sec:whole_novelgenes}). The most significant differentially-expressed novel gene was identified in Chromosome 10 (\cref{fig:whole_novelgene_difftracks}\textbf{a}), with progressive down-regulation in TG over time (\cref{fig:whole_novelgene_diffexp}\textbf{a}). The other differentially-expressed novel genes were found antisense to \textit{Fgfr1op} (\cref{fig:whole_novelgene_difftracks}\textbf{b}), within the gene-body, and to \textit{Htra1}  (\cref{fig:whole_novelgene_difftracks}\textbf{c}), at the 5'UTR. Both genes were associated with increased expression in TG compared to the WT over time (\cref{fig:whole_novelgene_diffexp}\textbf{b,d}). Notably, while \textit{Fgfr1op} was not identified as differentially-expressed (\cref{fig:whole_novelgene_diffexp}\textbf{c}), \textit{Htra1} was also found to have higher expression in TG compared to WT (\cref{fig:whole_novelgene_diffexp}\textbf{e}).

%\boldheader{Usage of Iso-Seq reads alone detected robust changes in gene expression}
While Iso-Seq reads are commonly used for accurately characterising RNA diveristy, we found that Iso-Seq reads were also able to accurately quantify the abundance of highly-expressed transcripts - as illustrated by the strong correlation of gene-level expression quantified using Iso-Seq and RNA-Seq reads, and near-perfect correlation Iso-Seq reads and actual amount of ERCC controls (described in XX). Strikingly, despite the lower long-read sequencing coverage and smaller sample size (n = 6 TG, n = 6 WT) sequenced on the long-read platform, a significant number of genes (n = 446 genes) were identified as differentially expressed when we used the Iso-Seq long reads for both annotation and expression. Using \textit{EnrichR}, differentially expressed genes (n = 466) were found to be highly enriched in lysosome (KEGG 2021 Human: odds ratio = 5.99, adjusted P = 4.41 x 10\textsuperscript{-6}) and in particularly the TGF-\textbeta pathway (WikiPathway 2021 Human: odds ratio = 58.98, adjusted P = 2.69 x 10\textsuperscript{-3} ). Classification of the differentially expressed genes by effects (depicted in \cref{fig:dea_model} and showcased in \cref{fig:dea_model_genexp}), further identified the majority (n = 340 genes, \cref{fig:dea_model_num}) to be associated with tau pathology (n = 23, \cref{fig:dea_model_genexp}\textbf{a}) and progressive with age (n = 340, \cref{fig:dea_model_genexp}\textbf{d,e,f,g}).

Usage of Iso-Seq reads alone identified differentially-expressed genes previously reported to be highly associated with AD. The top ranked tau-associated differentially-expressed genes that was found to be progressive with age in our previous analyse\cite{Castanho2020} was also recapitulated (\cref{fig:whole_dea}\textbf{a,b}): \textit{Gfap}, which encodes for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP\nomenclature{GFAP}{Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein}), a cytoskeletal protein that acts as a marker for astrocyte activation and proliferation - its increased expression was reported to correlate with increased neurofibrillary tangles density in Alzheimer's disease entorhinal cortex tissues \cite{Muramori1998}. Higher GFAP levels have also be documented in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in patients with AD compared to healthy control \cite{Ishiki2016}, and more recently, in plasma of cognitively intact older adults at risk of AD \cite{Chatterjee2021}.

Other top-ranked differentially-expressed genes have been reported to be involved in AD development and pathology, notably \textit{C4b} - a member of the complement immune system (\cref{fig:whole_dea}\textbf{c,d}), \textit{Slc14a1} encoding the urea transporter 1, \textit{Tgfbr1} encoding the TGF-\textbeta receptor protein (\cref{fig:whole_dea}\textbf{e,f}) and \textit{Unc93b1}, a transmemebrane protein required for toll (\cref{tab:dea_wholemouse}). Up-regulated expression of these genes have been observed previously in AD patients and other AD mouse models \cite{Zorzetto2016,Castillo2017,Wirz2013}.

\subsection{Differential Isoform Expression Analysis}
One of the added advantages of long reads over short-reads is the power to accurately identify isoforms and to explore isoform expression changes across conditions and over time. Using \textit{MaSigPro} with Iso-Seq reads as both reference annotation and expression, we identified hundreds of differentially expressed isoforms (n = 582 isoforms), of which 36 isoforms (6.19\%) were associated with rTg4510 genotype, and 378 isoforms (64.9\%) associated with progressive tau pathology. 

\boldheader{Robust changes in isoform expression associated with progressive tau pathology were identified with Iso-Seq annotation and expression}
Strikingly, the two most significant progressive-tau-associated differentially expressed isoforms were annotated to \textit{Gfap} (\cref{fig:DEI_gfap}) and \textit{C4b} (\cref{fig:DEI_c4b}), the top two most differentially-expressed genes (\cref{tab:dea_wholemouse}). Both genes were characterised by a dominant known isoform in rTg4510 mice, which was significantly up-regulated with progressive tau pathology (\cref{fig:DEI_gfap}\textbf{a}, \cref{fig:DEI_c4b}\textbf{a}), indicating that increased \textit{Gfap} (\cref{fig:whole_dea}\textbf{a}) and \textit{C4b} (\cref{fig:whole_dea}\textbf{c}) gene expression in rTg4510 mice were primarily driven by one associated isoform. Notably, expression of other minor novel isoforms was also higher in rTg4510 mice aged 8 months (\cref{fig:DEI_gfap}\textbf{b}, \cref{fig:DEI_c4b}\textbf{b}). A similar finding was also observed when using RNA-Seq reads as abundance, though tau-pathology associated expression changes in minor isoforms were significantly more pronounced - a reflection of the comparably higher sequencing coverage of RNA-Seq reads to Iso-Seq reads. 

Other isoforms that were significantly unregulated with progressive tau pathology were annotated to genes that have been previously strongly implicated in AD pathology and development (\cref{fig:DEI_ADgenes_isoseq}). This included ENSMUST00000151120.8 associated with \textit{Ctsd}, which encodes for Cathepsin D, a lysosomal protease that is involved in degradation of A$\beta$ \cite{JR1996}, tau \cite{A1997}, and has recently been identified as a key regulator of A$\beta$42/40 ratio \cite{Suire2020}. Other isoforms include ENSMUST00000172785.7 associated with \textit{H2-D1} - that encodes for major histocompatability complex (MHC) class 1, an immune-related gene that has been found to be upregulated in microglial cells of a different mouse model of neurodegeneration with AD-like phenotypes \cite{Mathys2017} - ENSMUST00000028624.8 associated with \textit{Gatm}, a mitochondrial protein that has been recently revealed as a key protein signature of AD from a large proteomic analysis of human cortex and CSF \cite{Wang2020}, - and ENSMUST00000030765.6 associated with \textit{Padi2}/\textit{Pad2}, an enzyme that has been found abnormally activated in astrocytes of patients with AD \cite{A2005}.

\boldheader{Iso-Seq reads can accurately quantify highly-expressed isoforms and identify significant expression changes in isoforms annotated to highly-expressed genes}
Observations of differential isoform expression using Iso-Seq reads as expression were recapitulated with RNA-Seq reads, highlighting the power to accurately quantify isoforms at high expression (\cref{fig:DEI_ADgenes_rnaseq}).
However, on closer examination, the majority of isoforms identified as differentially expressed with progressive tau pathology (n = 321, 84.9\%) were not similarly identified as differentially expressed when RNA-Seq reads were used as expression. Given that the wide majority of Iso-Seq-identified-differentially-expressed isoforms were very-lowly expressed (295 isoforms,91.9\%, with mean full-length counts < 24 FL, n = 12 samples) with low read count, a seemingly significant expression change may result in calling the isoform differentially expressed (\cref{fig:dei_lowisoexp}). However, even for more highly-expressed isoforms, while a change in mean expression was observed, the variance was substantial due to a small sample size (n = 3 replicates). Conversely, with a greater sample size (n = 6 replicates) and higher sequencing coverage of RNA-Seq reads, the usage of RNA-Seq reads as expression reduced the probability of calling an isoform as differentially expressed due to chance (\cref{fig:dei_highisoexp}).

\subsection{Differential Isoform Usage Analysis}
Contributing to the complexity of transcript regulation through alternative splicing, while the expression of a gene may be constant between conditions, the relative expression of the isoforms (and thus isoform proportion) can change. This phenomenon is known as differential transcript/isoform usage (DIU), and was also assessed using \textit{tappAS} for genes with more than one isoform. Of note, a major isoform switching event occurs when the dominant (major) isoform in one condition becomes a minor isoform in another.    

\boldheader{Usage of Iso-Seq reads results in many false positives due to insufficient sequencing depth}
Using Iso-Seq reads for annotation and expression and after filtering lowly-expressed isoforms, we identified 400 genes that were characterised with differential isoform usage. However upon further examination, the majority of these genes were lowly expressed and the associated isoforms that were observed to undergo differential usage had only 1-2 full-length long-read counts. We were therefore not confident in any of observed DIU changes detected with Iso-Seq abundance from the whole transcriptome sequencing due to low sequencing depth. Indeed, none of the DTU genes were significant after applying a gene expression threshold (described in \cref{ch:diu_method}).

% DIU genes with major switching	
In further support of this conclusion, there was a low overlap of DIU genes that were identified when we used RNA-Seq reads as expression. This was likely to be a reflection of lower sequencing depth of Iso-Seq reads, resulting in i) a different pool of isoforms after filtering lowly-expressed isoforms - a minor isoform was more likely to be filtered when using RNA-Seq reads as abundance rather than Iso-Seq reads, particularly if the overall gene expression was low, due to relatively greater expression difference, and ii) smaller differences in isoform expression using Iso-Seq reads are translated to misleading significant changes in isoform proportions, resulting in false detection of genes as DIU. These implications can be seen in the gene \textit{Esyt2}, whereby the low Iso-Seq isoform counts resulted in misleading representation of isoform fraction, which was not recapitulated when RNA-Seq reads were used as expression (\cref{fig:DIU_esyt2}).

		As can be observed, the Iso-Seq normalised counts are significantly lower than RNA-Seq normalised counts for the associated isoforms, resulting in a misleading representation of isoform fraction with major isoform switching events (Figure c, PB.3907.1 becomes the dominant isoform in transgenic mice), which is not recapitulated with RNA-Seq reads as expression (Figure d)}

\boldheader{Alignment of RNA-Seq reads to Iso-Seq defined transcriptome identified multiple genes with differential transcript usage with major switching events}
Differential isoform usage was performed with Iso-Seq reads as annotation and RNA-Seq reads as expression, given higher sequencing RNA-Seq read depth and greater sample size. 570 genes were identified with differential isoform usage (\cref{tab:DIU_DEA_nums}).

The majority of these genes (n = 498, 87.3\%), while observed with DIU, were not differentially expressed between wildtype and transgenic mice - a scenario whereby the differential upregulation of one isoform is compensated by the differential downregulation of another isoform, resulting in no net gene expression change. This indicates that a significant degree of the post-transcriptional regulation was independent of gene expression regulation. An example of this was \textit{Ptprz1}, a receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase, which is involved in oligodendrocyte development and function. While there was no change in overall gene expression, closer examination revealed progressive upregulation of two isoforms (PB.13000,10, PB.13000.11) which was offset by progressive downregulation of two other isoforms (PB.13000.14, PB.13000.7) in transgenic mice. In transgenic mice, the known isoform PB.13000.10 (ENSMUST00000090568.6) continued to dominate in both wildtype and transgenic mice across all ages with a slight increase. This was complemented by a slight decrease in the aother known shorter isoform PB.13000.14 (ENSMUST00000202579.3). Interestingly, the two other differentially expressed isoforms were novel, with skipping of exon 16. 

The most significant gene characterised with differential isoform usage with a dominant isoform switch but no change in gene expression was \textit{Cisd3}, a mitochondrial iron-sulfur domain-containing protein involved in regulating electron transport and iron homeostasis essential for normal mitochondrial function. While there was little change in overall gene expression, there is a major isoform shift between wildtype and transgenic mice that was generally consistent across all ages. The two isoforms only differ at the 5'end with the first exon of the upregulated isoform, ENSMUST00000107583.2 (PB.2833.2), spanning across exons 1 and 2 of the downregulated isoform, ENSMUST00000107584.7 (PB.2833.1).

%Interestingly, the was a lower consensus when comparing the number of DIU genes identified when using RNA-Seq reads as abundance, suggesting that the choice of filtering strategy becomes redundant when dealing with low sequencing depth.
