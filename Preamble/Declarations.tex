\chapter*{Declarations}

All mouse samples used in \textbf{Chapters 4 - 6}  were obtained from Eli Lilly \& Co.Ltd., Windlesham (United Kingdom). 

All laboratory work and analyses were performed by myself, with the following exceptions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Animal breeding procedures, sample collection, and subsequent RNA extractions and assessment from mouse samples (\textbf{Chapters 4 - 6}) were performed by Dr Isabel Castanho.
	\item Short-read RNA Sequencing was prepared and performed by Dr Isabel Castanho, Audrey Farbos and Dr Karen Moore at the University of Exeter Sequencing Service. Filtering of raw RNA-Seq reads were further carried out by by Dr Isabel Castanho.
	\item Sample loading and machine operation for Iso-Seq targeted sequencing of the final two Iso-Seq batches (described in \textbf{Chapter 6}) were performed by Dr Stefania Policicchio and Dr Aaron Jeffries at the University of Exeter Sequencing Service.  
	\item Nanopore library preparation and sequencing (after target capture, which was performed by myself, as described in \textbf{Chapter 6}) was performed with Dr Aaron Jeffries at the University of Exeter Sequencing Service. 	
	\item RNA extractions and assessment from AD post-mortem brain tissue (for preliminary results mentioned in \textbf{Chapter 7}) were performed by Greg Wheildon. Iso-Seq library preparation and targeted sequencing were subsequently performed by Dr Stefania Policicchio under my guidance.
\end{itemize}
