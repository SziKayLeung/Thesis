\section{Introduction}
One current limitation of whole transcriptome sequencing is the low coverage/sequencing depth achieved per gene due to the distribution of reads across the whole transcriptome. Consequently, while whole transcriptome sequencing allows identification of novel genes (genes not previously annotated to the genome) and novel isoforms, it may not detect isoforms particularly those of low expression resulting in many false negatives. This can be circumvented by the use of target capture, which enriches a selective panel of genes that are then only sequenced. Multiple samples can further be pooled and sequenced together by barcoding samples at cDNA synthesis, which simplifies laboratory workflow and minimises associated sequencing costs.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Samples}
Extracted RNA from mouse entorhinal cortex of wild-type and transgenic rTg4510 mice was sequenced on the PacBio's Sequel (n = 24, Table \ref{tab:mouse_samples_sequenced}), a subset of which were also sequenced on the Oxford Nanopore's MinION (n = 18, Table \ref{tab:mouse_samples_sequenced}). Three biological replicates were selected at each age (2, 4, 6 and 8 months) across wild-type and transgenic mice, multiplexed with barcodes (listed in \cref{tab:barcode_primers}) and sequenced as three batches.

\subsection{Library preparation and sequencing}
Following the Iso-Seq lab protocol (as described in \cref{chap:isoseq_labpipeline}), 200ng RNA from each sample was primed for first strand cDNA synthesis (\cref{section:ch2_cDNA_synthesis_explanation}) with specific oligo-dT barcodes and amplified using PCR with 14 cycles (\cref{fig:isoseq_targeted_pccresults}, \cref{section:ch2_PCR_explanation}). Following purification with 0.4X and 1X AMPure PB beads, the two fractions were then recombined at equimolar quantities, and samples were subsequently combined at equimolar quantities according to each batch. Enrichment for target genes with IDT hybridisation capture was then performed for each batch (described in \cref{section:ch2_targetcapture_explanation}) using custom-designed probes (summarised in \cref{tab:mouse_probes}). Following successful target capture, Iso-Seq library preparation (depicted in \cref{fig:isoseq_targeted_libresults}) was performed for each batch and sequenced on the PacBio Sequel using a 1M SMRT cell. A subset of the samples (Batch 2 and Batch 3) were also prepared with ONT library preparation (depicted in \cref{fig:ONT_targeted_libresults}) and sequenced on the ONT MinION with a FLO-Min106D flow cell (described in \cref{sec: ONTlib_preparation}). RNA from the same samples (n = 24) was also prepared with TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina) and subjected to 125bp paired-end sequencing using a HiSeq2500 (Illumina), and used as junction support of the long reads. 

\subsection{SMRT sequencing QC and data processing}
Processing of raw reads were performed using the Iso-Seq bioinformatics pipeline (outlined in \cref{section:isoseq_bioinformatics}), and is similar to the whole transcriptomics data processing with the exception of demultiplexing samples at \textit{Lima} with barcodes. Briefly, CCS reads were generated for each batch and demultiplexed for each sample. Full-length reads from each sample were then merged and collapsed to unique isoforms with \textit{Cupcake}, which were mapped to mouse reference genome (mm10) using \textit{Minimap2} and annotated with \textit{SQANTI3}. Partial isoforms as a consequence of 5'degradation were filtered out using \textit{TAMA}'s script (tama\_remove\_fragment\_models.py) with default parameters. Full-length Iso-Seq read counts from each individual sample were extracted from \textit{Cupcake's} read\_stat.txt file .For the targeted transcriptome approach, whereby the samples were barcoded and thus could not be differentiated by sequencing run, we used the ID (original CCS read) documented in the output file (flnc.report.csv) from \textit{Iso-Seq3 Refine} after sample demultiplexing.

	As can be seen across all figures, target capture appears to be successful with detected peaks, reflecting enrichment of target transcripts with specific lengths, which differs from the broad peaks that are evident in whole transcriptome sequencing (Figure \ref{fig:isoseq_whole_bioresults}). Library preparation with ligation of SMRT bell templates retained these targeted transcripts with good peak overlay, as seen in figure e). The difference in peak height (i.e. cDNA quantity) between target capture and library preparation is due to a difference in input cDNA concentration when running Bioanalyzer - input cDNA after library preparation was diluted with a 1:5 dilution factor to maximise amount of cDNA available for sequencing, whereas input cDNA after target capture was not diluted.}

Briefly, cDNA was similarly prepared from 200ng RNA using the SMARTer PCR cDNA Synthesis Kit (Clontech, UK) (described in \cref{section:ch2_cDNA_synthesis_explanation}), with addition of ERCC standards, followed by PCR amplification of 14 cycles with PrimeSTAR GXL DNA Polymerase (Clontech, UK) (described in \cref{section:ch2_PCR_explanation}). Quantification and size distribution were then determined using Qubit DNA High sensitivity assay (Invitrogen) and Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent), and library preparation was proceeded with ONT’s Ligation Sequencing kit (SQK-LSK109) (detailed in \cref{sec: ONTlib_preparation}). Sequencing was then performed on ONT MinION using a FLO-Min106D flow cell (detailed in \cref{sec: ONTlib_sequencing}). 

\subsection{ONT QC and data processing}
QC of raw reads was performed using PycoQC, with subsequent analysis using the ONT bioinformatics pipeline (details are provided in \cref{section:ont_bioinformatics}). Briefly, raw reads were basecalled using \textit{Guppy} (v4.0) and reads with Phred (Q) < 7 filtered out. Primers and ONT adapters were then removed using \textit{Porechop} to generate full-length reads, followed by trimming of polyA tails with \textit{Cutadapt}. Full-length reads were then mapped to the reference mouse genome using \textit{Minimap2} (v2.17) with the following parameters "-ax splice". Owing to the high error rate attributed to ONT sequencing, artifactual noncanonical splice junctions from aligned reads were corrected with \textit{Transcript Clean} and corrected reads were subsequently processed using \textit{TALON} for annotation, quantification and filtering for intrapriming (--maxFracA = 0.5). Novel transcripts were only retained if detected with minimum 2 reads in at least 2 samples.

Supplementing \cref{fig:ONT_PacBio_bioinformatics}, raw ONT reads from each flow cell were processed and the demultiplexed into the respective samples, which were then processed independently for collapse and transcript quantification. All the samples from both batches were then merged into one complete dataset, while retaining sample-specific transcript expression.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Comparison of Iso-Seq and Nanopore datasets}
The Iso-Seq targeted dataset (n = 24 samples) was examined with other datasets using \textit{Gffcompare}; such datasets included transcripts identified from whole transcriptome profiling (n = 12 samples) and ONT-derived transcripts from nanopore targeted sequencing (n = 18 samples). For a fairer comparison, Iso-Seq transcripts from whole transcriptome profiling were re-annotated with \textit{SQANTI3} with no splice junction filtering from short-read RNA-Seq data, and only coverage from the same samples were used for the comparison between the whole and targeted Iso-Seq datasets. Conversely, all processed but unfiltered ONT reads were used for a comprehensive comparison between the two technologies with Iso-Seq derived transcripts as reference.   

\subsection{Transcript annotation and Iso-Seq Quantification}
For a comprehensive characterisation of the AD-associated genes enriched in the mouse transcriptome, the Iso-Seq and ONT datasets were merged using \textit{Gffcompare}. In order to retain both filtered ONT-derived transcripts (minimum 2 reads in at least 2 samples) and ONT-derived transcripts that did not pass through filtering but were also detected using the Iso-Seq platform, a custom python script was written to parse the output from \textit{Gffcompare} to identify Iso-Seq and ONT-derived transcripts with a complete exact match (defined by the class code "="), unique filtered ONT-derived and unqique Iso-Seq-derived transcripts. An output file of the abundance was also generated for each transcript and sample, using the counts either provided from \textit{Cupcake} for Iso-Seq-derived-transcripts, \textit{TALON} for ONT-derived-transcripts or the summation of both for transcripts that were commonly detected in both technologies. The merged dataset was then annotated with \textit{SQANTI3} in combination with mouse reference gene annotations (mouse GENCODE, vm22), FANTOM5 CAGE peaks and \textit{STAR}-aligned RNA-Seq junctions, and were classified as either FSM, ISM, NIC, NNC, antisense, fusion, and intergenic (described in \cref{section: sqanti_annotations}). Transcripts classified as ISM with 3'fragment were assumed to be partial 5'RNA degraded products and discarded. ORFs were predicted using the CPAT program (v3.0.2) using all default parameters and transcripts were predicted as protein-coding if the coding potential score was >0.44 for mouse (CPAT recommended parameters)  

\subsection{Characterisation of AS events and transcript visualisation}
To date, current tools for assessing alternative splicing events were developed for short-read RNA-Seq data and fail to capture the connectivity and complexity of long-read-derived isoforms, particularly in targeted profiling of the transcriptome with deep sequencing coverage. A custom python script was therefore written to accurately assess the occurrence of alternative splicing events based on splice junction coordinates of transcript exons relative to exons of all known GENCODE transcripts (mm10). Common alternative splicing events such as alternative first exons (AF), alternative last exons (AL), alternative 5' splice sites (A5), alternative 3' splice sites (A3), intron retention (IR) and exon skipping were assessed. Furthermore, other regulatory mechanisms such as alternative transcription initiation defined by alternative promoter/TSS, alternative termination likewise defined by alternative TTS, and presence of novel exons were evaluated using this custom script.


Alternative 5' and 3' splice sites were defined as splice sites differing by more than 10bp from the known splice site, and an intron was considered retained if the exon splice site differed by more than 100bp from the known splice site. Isoforms were visualised using UCSC genome browser, and were grouped by their splicing patterns to ease visualisation based on the following rank prioritisation: i) all exons with exact splice junction coordinates to know exons, ii) alternative first exons, iii) contain novel exons upstream of first exon, iv) novel exons downstream of last exon, v) characterised with intron retention, exon skipping and novel exons, vi) IR and ES, vii) novel exons within known exons, viii) IR only, ix) ES only and x) all exons with alternative 5' and 3' sites.

%ISM isoforms were assumed as partial products of longer FSM isoforms, and associated read counts were aggregated.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Iso-Seq Run performance and sequencing metrics}
Following Iso-Seq library preparation and SMRT sequencing, a total of XXGb (s.d = XXGb) were obtained (Table \ref{tab:targeted_mouse_run_output}). Of note, 6 samples were first trialled and multiplexed in Batch 1 to determine the yield output and coverage depth - PacBio recommends starting with 4 - 8 samples for multiplexing. Having noticed that an average yield output (24Gb) with a high off-target sequencing, implicating saturation of target genes with 6 samples, the number was increased to 9 samples in Batch 2 and Batch 3. Despite more samples, the sequencing run for Batch 2 and 3, performed by Exeter's Seqeuncing Service, had a poor loading rate (38.1\% P1 of Batch 3 vs 71\% of Batch 1) and low subsequent yield. The samples were also potentially degraded after having been stored in -20\textdegree C for over 6 months due to Covid-19 lockdown. 

The yield difference between the first and last two batches was evident in the number of CCS reads (total = 996K; Batch 1 = 469K, Batch 2 = 306K, Batch 3 = 2221K Figure \ref{fig:isoseq_targeted_run_output}a) and FLNC reads (total = 930K; Batch 1 = 399K, Batch 2 = 275K, Batch 3 = 256K, Figure \ref{fig:isoseq_targeted_run_output}a) generated, after applying the bioinformatics Iso-Seq pipeline (same as the whole transcriptome approach with the exception of removing barcodes rather than general primers). However, calculation of the on-target rate suggested that while Batch 2 and 3 had lower output yield, the coverage of target genes was significantly greater than Batch 1 due to the increased sample size (mean rate in Batch 1 = 34.5\%; mean rate in Batch 2 = 46.2\%; mean rate in Batch 3: 42.9\%, Figure \ref{fig:isoseq_targeted_rate}). The on-target rate is defined as the proportion of mapped transcripts with sequences overlapping at least one target probe. 
%Off-target 

In addition to batch variability, the number of full-length transcripts obtained per sample varied within each batch (Figure \ref{fig:isoseq_targeted_run_output}b). This variability was not associated with RIN (corr = 0.147, P = 0.492, Spearman's rank) and is unlikely to be due to library preparation, given that samples were pooled in equal molarity during target capture. However, there was no significant difference in the number of full-length transcripts between WT and TG across the batched runs (Wilcoxon rank sum test, W = 73, P = 0.977, Figure \ref{fig:isoseq_targeted_run_output}c).

\subsection{ONT Run performance and sequencing metrics}
Following library preparation and nanopore sequencing on a subset of samples, a total of 28.54M reads (39.68Gb) were generated across two flow cells and a total of 22.8M (80\%) reads were successfully basecalled using \textit{Guppy} (\cref{tab:ont_targetedrun_output}). Despite similar amount of loading onto the flow cell (Batch 2: 540ng, Batch 3: 500ng), there was a large yield difference in the number of basecalled reads between the two batches with Batch 3 generating significantly more reads (Batch 2: 12.3M and Batch 3: 16.3M), and after filtering for read quality (Phred Score > Q7, referring to a read accuracy > 80\%) of which the majority reads passed (Batch 2: 9.68 (78.8\%); Batch 3: 13.13M (99.3\%) (\cref{fig:ONT_targeted_run_output}\textbf{a}). 

Similar to Iso-Seq Targeted Transcriptome run performance, the number of filtered reads obtained per sample varied within each batch (\cref{fig:ONT_targeted_run_output}\textbf{B}), with more reads generated in the transgenic mice in both Batches 2 and 3 (\cref{fig:ONT_targeted_run_output}\textbf{c}, Batch 2: Wilcoxon rank sum test, W = 18, P = 0.063; Batch 3: Wilcoxon rank sum test, W = 17, P = 0.11). This variability was not associated with RIN (corr = -0.267, P = 0.284, Spearman's rank) or barcode (corr = -0.058, P = 0.819, Spearman's rank), but simply a reflection of more transgenic mice sequenced (Batch 2: WT = 4, TG = 5 samples; Batch 3: WT = 4, TG = 5 samples). The difference in number of WT and TG mice in Batches 2 and 3 would have been compensated in Iso-Seq with Batch 1, where there is more WT mice; however, Batch 1 was not sequenced using ONT due to the lack of remaining cDNA. Of note, the difference in the number of reads between TG and WT, while different, was not statistically significant at the 5\% level (Wilcoxon rank sum test, W = 59, P = 0.10, \cref{fig:ONT_targeted_run_output}\textbf{d}).
  
While the throughput was comparable between Iso-Seq and ONT nanopore sequencing for the targeted transcriptome profiling (Iso-Seq: 19.3 - 24.2Gb, ONT: 16.9 - 22.8Gb), ONT nanopore sequencing generated significantly more (1D) reads (12.3M - 16.3M) than the polymerase reads from Iso-Seq (0.3M - 0.7M), which is limited by the number of wells available for sequencing (1M ZMWs), and subsequently 20X the number of full-length reads per sample (Iso-Seq mean PolyA-FLNC reads = 38.7K, range = 16.8K - 77.2K; ONT mean basecalled, filtered reads = 918K, range = 667K - 1.32M). This significant difference in read but comparable yield output is due to the multiple sequencing of the same insert in Iso-Seq with the generation of CCS reads, whereas each insert is only sequenced once in ONT nanopore. This significantly higher yield is therefore achieved at the expense of read accuracy, whereby the average read accuracy in ONT nanopore is 90\% (mean Phred Quality = 10; \cref{tab:ont_targetedrun_output)}, \cref{fig:ont_targetedlengthquality}\textbf{a,b}). Of note, the on-target rate observed in both Iso-Seq and ONT nanopore sequencing was similar at $\tilde{50\%}$ (\cref{fig:isoseq_targeted_rate,fig:ont_targeted_rate}), indicating that more samples could have been sequenced.

\subsection{Iso-Seq Targeted approach detects many more novel transcripts than whole transcriptome profiling}
% Number of Iso-Seq transcripts
After filtering for technical artefacts (563 (1.69\%) isoforms were removed due to intra-priming, 314 (0.94\%) isoforms were removed due to RT switching, 1,267 (3.80\%) were removed due to likely partial degradation), a total of 4,780 isoforms were detected across 20 AD-associated target genes across all the samples (n = 24). Of these isoforms, an overwhelming majority were novel (n = 4601, 96.2\%) with no RNA-Seq support (n = 24 samples, total number of uniquely mapped reads = 360 million) at the junction (n = 4,033, 84.4\%). This is likely to be reflection of the low coverage of RNA-Seq reads per sample (mean number of uniquely mapped reads = 15 million) to comprehensively span these novel junctions, rather than an indication of the invalidity of these isoforms given the stringent processing of the Iso-Seq bioinformatics pipeline. 

We next wanted to compare the isoform diversity and sequencing coverage of the panel of AD-associated genes captured using the targeted and whole transcriptome approach. As expected, enrichment and selective sequencing of the target genes detected many more transcripts that were not detected in the whole transcriptome approach, the majority of which were novel (NIC: XX, XX\%; NNC: XX, XX\%). Further examination of these transcripts unique to the targeted approach revealed them to be more lowly-expressed than the transcripts detected from both sequencing approaches, highlighting the greater sensitivity of the targeted approach in detecting the novel, rarer transcripts. 

Conversely with a target rate of \textasciitilde{XX\%}, the targeted sequencing experiments detected many isoforms associated with non-target genes, which were found to be more highly expressed than the isoforms of non-target genes that were uniquely detected in the whole transcriptome approach. This indicates that the off-target genes from the targeted transcriptome are the most abundance rather than based on similar sequence homology to garget genes. 

Intriguingly, the whole transcriptome approach detected isoforms associated with all the target genes with the exception of \textit{Trpa1}, which is the least expressed in the mouse cortex and was only detected in the targeted approach.  Given that we have previously showed that our whole transcriptome Iso-Seq sequencing datasets (n = 12 samples) was close to saturation, we do not anticipate that we would detect \textit{Trpa1} with more samples. This suggests that our sequencing coverage at a total XX Iso-Seq reads were capped at detecting genes above XXTPM.

\subsection{ONT achieves significantly deeper sequencing coverage than Iso-Seq with enrichment of shorter novel transcripts}
A total of XX transcripts were identified after enrichment of 20 AD-associated genes followed by nanopore sequencing (median = XX, range = XX - XX). Further filtering of novel transcripts by expression (minimum 2 reads in 2 samples) reduced the total number of transcripts by XX fold, suggesting that a vast number of ONT novel transcripts were detected with one FL read and were not reproducibly detected across biological replicates. 

After filtering, we detected a total of XXX isoforms across the same panel of AD-associated genes - XX times more than the Iso-Seq targeted dataset despite sequencing fewer samples (Iso-Seq: n = 24 samples, ONT = 18 samples). Similar to Iso-Seq dataset, target gene expression level was strongly correlated between ONT expression and RNA-Seq expression. However, strikingly the order of the isoform diversity across the panel differed between the two datasets - i.e. \textit{XXX} was associated with the greatest number of transcripts in Iso-Seq whilst \textit{XXX} was the most "isoformic" in ONT dataset, suggesting that some genes were more likely to be sequenced using the ONT platform. Further examination of the two datasets revealed an enrichment of transcripts sized 1-2kb with 5 exons (mean = X, XX) whereas Iso-Seq-derived transcripts were typically longer with more exons (mean = X, XX). This suggests an over-representation of shorter transcripts in the ONT library, a phenomenon that has been previously reported and may be attributed to premature termination of ONT transcript sequencing.

\end{figure}

However, significantly more ONT-derived Transcripts were found with TSS annotated with 50bp of a CAGE peak compared to Iso-Seq-derived transcripts, half of which were found over 200bp from the closest annotated CAGE peak. The 5' and 3' ends of ONT-derived transcripts were also more likely to be within 50bp from the closest annotated 5' and 3' ends of the target gene. Perhaps even more telling, a greater proportion of Iso-Seq-derived transcripts were classified as "ISM" (Incomplete Splice Match) with a 3' fragment that matches the 3'end of a known transcript, and are likely to represent truncated products. Furthermore, the majority of ONT-derived transcripts were supported by matched short-read RNA-Seq data (support is defined by all splice junctions supported by more than 1 RNA-Seq read) whereas almost all Iso-Seq-derived transcripts were supported. Notably, a significant difference in number of transcripts supported by RNA-Seq reads was observed with Iso-Seq derived transcripts more likely to be supported - however, we suspect this difference is driven by the greater sensitivity of ONT to detect rare, novel transcripts and relatively insufficient coverage of RNA-Seq reads. Examination of these novel transcripts not supported by RNA-Seq revealed them to be less abundant (median expression = XX FL reads) compared to those supported by RNA-Seq (median expression = XX FL reads).  However, no significant difference in the number of transcripts located to 50bp of CAGE peak was found (Fisher's exact test: XXX), highlighting the power of targeted sequencing for detection of rare, novel isoforms.

\end{figure}

Comparison of the two datasets using \textit{Gffcompare} revealed that the vast majority of Iso-Seq derived transcripts were also detected in ONT nanopore sequencing (n = XX transcripts, XX\%),whereas only a small proportion of filtered ONT-transcripts were detected in Iso-Seq (n = XX transcripts, XX\%). Further examination of these unique ONT-derived transcripts revealed them to be more lowly-expressed and shorter with fewer exons than the commonly-detected ONT-derived transcripts, demonstrating ONT's greater sensitivity at detecting shorter transcripts. In contrast, no difference in length or exon number was observed between the unique and commonly-detected Iso-Seq derived transcripts, suggesting that these are transcripts that were unique to the remaining samples that were not sequenced with ONT. 

Finally, we compared the number of isoforms from the Iso-Seq and ONT datasets against the number of known reference isoforms, the gene length, transcript length (longest known reference isoform) and number of exons. Similar to previous findings, the number of detected isoforms in the Iso-Seq dataset was strongly correlated with gene length and the number of known associated isoforms. However strikingly, a significantly weaker correlation was observed between the number of detected isoforms in the ONT dataset with known isoform number and gene length. Given that far more novel isoforms were detected in ONT dataset with greater sequencing coverage and depth compared to Iso-Seq dataset, this suggests that gene length and number of exons are not the primary driving factors of isoform diversity in this panel of target genes.

\subsection{Merged Annotations}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Despite characterised with 27 exons, Trpa1 only detected with the two isoforms that are known and XX novel isoforms. Of note, Trpa1 is lowly expressed but low isoform number unlikely to reflect sequencing coverage given dataset reached saturation. Similarly Rhbdf2, despite characterised with 20 exons, only detected relatively few isoforms compared to some of the other target genes. Or Abca1, with 50 exons but similarly relatively few isoforms (majority are from truncated ONT transcripts likely to be partial degraded artifacts)
	\item Of note, with Rhbdf2, only 1 of the 4 known transcripts were detected in different variation, possibly reflecting the low gene expression. 
	\item Sorl1 has 48 exons, but only 1 long known transcript
	\item Ank1: long transcripts were only detected in ONT and not Iso-Seq targeted transcriptome, a likely reflection of degradation (given that the longer transcript was detected in the whole transcriptome profiling). Nonetheless, there appears to be an enrichment of the shorter transcripts with the highest expression in the shortest non-coding transcript (which is detected in both PacBio and ONT as the most highly expressed in either platform?). Unable to rule out that the transcript limit could be due to a technical limitation to sequence longer transcripts.  
	\item Conversely, Vgf only 5 exons, though the 4 of the 5 known isoforms only have two exons. 
 	\item Abca1, Abca7 A lot of partial products reflecting limitation of long-range PCR. 	
 	\item Relationship between length of 3'UTR and variation? Sorl1 many transcripts with set lengths of 3'UTR, Cd33 also has long UTR but no skipping or mismatch. Despite, only two exons, complexity of Vgf driven by the long UTR and different variations of the 3'UTR 
 	\item Complexity of transcripts from mismatch and match of different ends i.e. Trem2, Apoe
 	\item Fus has a long UTR but only one transcript with this long UTR 	
 	\item exon skipping of the constitutive exons vs alternative exons?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Interesting Gene observations}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Abca7} A lot of IR at the end of the transcripts but do not shift the open reading frame i.e. not NMD; Also exon skipping but appear exclusive to either one of two exons, also supported by both technologies 
	\item \textit{Cd33}: Despite long UTR, no skipping or mismatch observed, rather isoform complexity is driven by intron retention from exon 5 onwards. Also novel exon of XX bp --> functional implications?
	\item \textit{Sorl1}: Does not have many ES transcripts despite the number of exons
	\item \textit{Trem2}: Skipping of Exon 2 are all non-coding, shifts the ORF? A lot of variation of Exon2. Presence of Mismatch and match transcripts from alternative exon 1. Upstream novel exons --> functional implications. Require qPCR validation (discussion) 
	\item \textit{Vgf} is a neurosecretory protein that is cleaved into different peptides --> variation of the 3'UTR reflect the generation of different peptides. Of note, observe transcripts without the 5'end of the UTR are not coding, suggesting shift ORF. NE first exon --> implications 
	\item Fus ---> Intron Retention specific to exons 4, exact match with other exons. The full-length transcript most dominant with all exons expressed, rather than the shorter transcripts and no exon skipping observed. 
	\item Bin1 IR and ES occurs mostly at the non-constitutively spliced alternative exons, though also in the constitutive exons. 
	\item Ptk2b IR heavily supported by both PacBio and ONT 
	\item Snca --> long 3'UTR in some transcripts, functional implications? new motifs or binding sites?
	\item Clu --> A lot of transcripts with IR AP of a specific novel exon
	\item Apoe; A5A3 truncation of exon 2 observed in several transcripts
\end{itemize} 

\subsubsection{Trem2}
A total of XX \textit{Trem2} isoforms were detected, with the majority of isoforms containing canonical splice sites (GT-AG or GC-AC) (n = XX, XX\%). Approximately half of these isoforms have all five exons, differing in the use of alternative 5' start and 3' end sites. The remaining isoforms were characterised with complex alternative splicing with XX observed with exon skipping and XX with intron retention. Exon X was observed to be skipped the most (n = XX isoforms), followed by Exon X (n = XX isoforms), and Exon X (n = XX isoforms). "ORF prediction shows skipping of such exons shortens the ORF but maintains the reading frame". 

XX of isoforms were also characterised with novel exons, with XX isoforms containing novel exons upstream of the first known exon, XX isoforms containing novel exons downstream of the last exon, and XX isoforms containing a XXbp novel exon XX. Adding to the layer of complexity, such isoforms were characterised by multiple splicing events. 

Using the merged full-length read count as a proxy for isoform abundance, one of the canonical isoform (XXX) was found to be most abundance with an abundance of XX-XX\% across all samples. Grouping the isoforms by splicing patterns, isoforms with all five exons accounted for XX\% of abundance. Corroborating previous findings that intron-retained transcripts with less abundantly expressed, isoforms with intron retention accounted for XX\% of abundance.

\subsection{RNA-Seq Alignment to Iso-Seq defined transcriptome}
For the hybrid approach of aligning short reads to Iso-Seq defined transcriptome from the targeted approach, several factors were optimised including the library size and the Iso-Seq annotation (\cref{tab:rnaseq_alignment_targeted}) to align RNA-Seq reads to targeted transcriptome dataset using \textit{Kallisto}.

However, independent of the scaffold or library size, \textit{Kallisto} appeared to mis-assign short reads to novel isoforms. This is exemplified with \textit{Clu} (\cref{fig:Clu_TargetedRNAseqAlignment}) and \textit{Bin1} (\cref{fig:Bin1_TargetedRNAseqAlignment}).   Using total Iso-Seq FL reads from targeted transcriptome as proxy of transcript expression, the known and longer isoforms associated with both \textit{Clu} (\cref{fig:Clu_TargetedRNAseqAlignment}\textbf{A}) and \textit{Bin1}(\cref{fig:Bin1_TargetedRNAseqAlignment}\textbf{A}) were most abundant whereas the novel isoforms were only lowly detected. Conversely, alignment of RNA-Seq reads to targeted transcriptome often ascribed the novel isoforms as the dominant isoform(s), particularly when further collapsing targeted transcriptome to longest or most abundantly expressed isoforms or limiting the scaffold to only on-target reads (Methods 2 - 5 from \cref{tab:rnaseq_alignment_targeted}). Nonetheless, while using all the reads from the targeted transcriptome with redundant ISM and FSM is more likely to ascribe the known isoform as the dominant isoform, mis-asignment can still occur with the shorter, redundant ISM annotated as most abundantly expressed rather than the longer, complete FSM (\cref{fig:Clu_TargetedRNAseqAlignment}\textbf{a, b, d}).

Visualisations of the dominant known isoform ascribed by Iso-Seq FL read counts and the dominant novel isoform ascribed by RNA-Seq alignment from \textit{Clu} and \textit{Bin1} show that both isoforms are structurally very similar, with almost identical internal exonic structure bar one or two exons with differing splice junctions. There was no difference in RNA-Seq coverage from \textit{Kallisto} alignment to targeted transcriptome across all the methods \cref{tab:rnaseq_alignment_targeted}), suggesting that the issue is the probabilistic assignment of reads to isoforms (Expectation-Maximum algorithm) rather than the alignment. It appears that in cases where the known and novel isoforms are similar in transcript structure, and consequently there are only a few short reads that can be unambiguously assigned, \textit{Kallisto} fails to quantify at an isoform level. Given that significantly more novel isoforms are identified using the targeted approach than the whole transcriptome approach, this is more likely to be evident in the former.

%Alternative splicing events?

\boldheader{Mapt}
7 known isoforms detected (ENSMUST00000106992.9, ENSMUST00000100347.10, ENSMUST00000138384.7, ENSMUST00000106988.7, ENSMUST00000126820.1, ENSMUST00000132245.7, ENSMUST00000106993.9) with ENSMUST00000106992.9 the dominant isoform. 
56 novel isoforms detected (22 NIC and 34 NNC), 4 with intron retention and 6 predicted for NMD.  
RNA-Seq expression and Iso-Seq expression show very different profile due to RNA-Seq reads also from sequencing transgene human \textit{MAPT} - conversely any full-length transcript containing human \textit{MAPT} transgene would have been filtered out during Iso-Seq bioinformatics pipeline, thus Iso-Seq reads would only capture mouse \textit{MAPT} isoforms. Unable to use RNA-Seq reads due to sequencing of human transgene; No differential mouse \textit{MAPT} gene or transcript expression. 
Antisense transcript to MAPT also detected.
%Of note: 2 ISMs have have semi high expression counts and may be multimapped; apply a threshold to ensure that must have more than x number of exons from the known but caveats?
%humanMAPT decreases but progressive tau pathology?


\subsection{Alternative splicing in Target Genes}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Sorl1: intron retention and two were predicted for NMD (PB.8560.84 with a different polyA motif and PB.8560.39)
	\item Bin1: multiple intron retention events; 11 isoforms were characterised with intron retention, of which all but one was predicted for NMD. 9 additional isoforms were predicted for NMD. - higher level of intron retention in AD mice?
	\item Ptk2b: 6 isoforms with intron retention
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Isoform expression}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Detected many novel isoforms using Iso-Seq reads with lower expression
	\item Despite detecting many isoforms, some genes only have one dominant isoform which is typically the known (Sorl1, Tardbp, Clu, particularly in the case with APP with 118 isoforms detected)
	\item Some isoforms that appear to be all similarly expressed (Picalm)
	\item Very lowly expressed Trpa1 and Rhbdf2 with only one isoform and three isoforms detected respectively
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Differential transcript expression}

\begin{itemize}
	\item As would be expected, target transcriptome detected more isoforms per associated gene than whole transcriptome (with the exception of \textit{Ank1,Snca}) and lowly-expressed genes not otherwise detected in whole transcriptome, including \textit{Cd33},\textit{Rhbdf2}, \textit{Trpa1}
	\item Across all genes independent of sequencing approach, RNA-Seq expression of associated gene and isoform is significantly higher than corresponding Iso-Seq expression, reflecting of higher sequencing coverage and sample size 
	\item Except for \textit{Trem2}, differential gene and transcript expression was only identified in whole transcriptome when RNA-Seq was used as expression (rather than Iso-Seq)
	\item This observation was recapitulated in targeted transcriptome with \textit{Abca1} and \textit{Clu}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Abca1: RNA-Seq expression identified differential gene and isoform expression with increased expression of known isoform with progressive tau pathology. A smaller general trend is observed with Iso-Seq data alone but insignificant.
	\item Bin1 Differential transcript expression observed using Iso-Seq reads with increased expression of novel isoform (PB.3915.524, NIC, P = 3.66 x 10\textsuperscript{-5}, R-squared = 0.547), but this was not recapitulated with RNA-Seq reads.
	\item Tardby: 18 novel isoforms, the majority of which were characterised with intron retention (n = 14) and also predicted for NMD (n = 8) and 3 additional for NMD
	\item App: Differential transcript expression observed using Iso-Seq reads with increased expression of known isoform (ENSMUST00000227654.1, P = 1.75 x 10\textsuperscript{-8}, R-squared = 0.657), but this was not recapitulated with RNA-Seq reads
	\item Sorl1: Differential transcript expression observed using Iso-Seq reads with increased expression of known isoform (ENSMUST00000089250.8, P = 2.317 x 10\textsuperscript{-8}, R-squared = 0.634), but this was not recapitulated with RNA-Seq reads.
	\item Clu: Differential gene and isoform expression was detected using RNA-Seq reads as expression, with upregulated expression associated with progressive tau pathology. However, this increase expression was attributed to a novel isoform (G4103.43,PB.2634.299) rather than the known longer isoform
	\item Differential gene expression identified using both Iso-Seq and RNA-Seq reads as expression with TG showing increased gene expression across progressive tau pathology. Iso-Seq attributed this increase to the known isoform (PB.7333.28, ENSMUST00000173739.7), whereas RNA-Seq attributed this increase to the novel isoform (G11287.50)
	\item Cd33: Differential gene expression and isoform expression was observed using both Iso-Seq and RNA-Seq reads, driven by upregulated expression of the known isoform (PB.7476.2), which was also detected in the whole transcriptome. 
	\item Observed significant differential gene expression and transcript expression - increased gene expression associated with progressive tau pathology, which is attributed to the known isoform (ENSMUST00000024791.14).
\end{itemize}
