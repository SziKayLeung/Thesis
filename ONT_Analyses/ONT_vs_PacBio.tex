\subsection{Comparisons of PacBio vs ONT for RNA-Sequencing} 

-	Comparing Read lengths 
-	Mappability 
-	Chimeric and gapped alignments 
-	Error patterns 
-	Isoform identification 
-	Isoform abundance estimation 

Sequencing quality (fraction of reads aligned) on read lengths for single pass reads (subreads for PacBio) and multi-pass consensus reads (CCS for PacBio and 2D reads for ONT) 
Fraction of Read aligned in bins

Context specific errors 

Pacbio non-size selection and Oxford Nanopore non-size selection

Lowly expressed gene and minor isoform quantification
