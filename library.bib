abstract = {The majority of mammalian genes produce multiple transcripts resulting from alternative splicing (AS) and/or alternative transcription initiation (ATI) and alternative transcription termination (ATT). Comparative analysis of the number of alternative nucleotides, isoforms, and introns per locus in genes with different types of alternative events suggests that ATI and ATT contribute to the diversity of human and mouse transcriptome even more than AS. There is a strong negative correlation between AS and ATI in 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) and AS in coding sequences (CDSs) but an even stronger positive correlation between AS in CDSs and ATT in 3' UTRs. These observations could reflect preferential regulation of distinct, large groups of genes by different mechanisms: 1) regulation at the level of transcription initiation and initiation of translation resulting from ATI and AS in 5' UTRs and 2) posttranslational regulation by different protein isoforms. The tight linkage between AS in CDSs and ATT in 3' UTRs suggests that variability of 3' UTRs mediates differential translational regulation of alternative protein forms. Together, the results imply coordinate evolution of AS and alternative transcription, processes that occur concomitantly within gene expression factories. {\textcopyright}The Author(s)2010.},

abstract = {Neurexin 1 (NRXN1), a presynaptic cell adhesion molecule, is implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by synaptic dysfunction including autism, intellectual disability and schizophrenia. To gain insight into NRXN1's involvement in human cortical development we used quantitative real-time PCR to examine the expression trajectories of NRXN1, and its predominant isoforms, NRXN1-$\alpha$ and NRXN1-$\beta$, in prefrontal cortex from fetal stages to aging. In addition, we investigated whether prefrontal cortical expression levels of NRXN1 transcripts are altered in schizophrenia or bipolar disorder in comparison with non-psychiatric control subjects. We observed that all three NRXN1 transcripts were highly expressed during human fetal cortical development, markedly increasing with gestational age. In the postnatal dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, expression levels were negatively correlated with age, peaking at birth until {\~{}} 3 years of age, after which levels declined markedly to be stable across the lifespan. NRXN1-$\beta$ expression was modestly but significantly elevated in the brains of patients with schizophrenia compared with non-psychiatric controls, whereas NRXN1-$\alpha$ expression was increased in bipolar disorder. These data provide novel evidence that NRXN1 expression is highest in human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during critical developmental windows relevant to the onset and diagnosis of a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, and that NRXN1 expression may be differentially altered in neuropsychiatric disorders.},

@article{Guan2016,
abstract = {Structural variations (SVs) are mutations in the genome of size at least fifty nucleotides. They contribute to the phenotypic differences among healthy individuals, cause severe diseases and even cancers by breaking or linking genes. Thus, it is crucial to systematically profile SVs in the genome. In the past decade, many next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based SV detection methods have been proposed due to the significant cost reduction of NGS experiments and their ability to unbiasedly detect SVs to the base-pair resolution. These SV detection methods vary in both sensitivity and specificity, since they use different SV-property-dependent and library-property-dependent features. As a result, predictions from different SV callers are often inconsistent. Besides, the noises in the data (both platform-specific sequencing error and artificial chimeric reads) impede the specificity of SV detection. Poorly characterized regions in the human genome (e.g., repeat regions) greatly impact the reads mapping and in turn affect the SV calling accuracy. Calling of complex SVs requires specialized SV callers. Apart from accuracy, processing speed of SV caller is another factor deciding its usability. Knowing the pros and cons of different SV calling techniques and the objectives of the biological study are essential for biologists and bioinformaticians to make informed decisions. This paper describes different components in the SV calling pipeline and reviews the techniques used by existing SV callers. Through simulation study, we also demonstrate that library properties, especially insert size, greatly impact the sensitivity of different SV callers. We hope the community can benefit from this work both in designing new SV calling methods and in selecting the appropriate SV caller for specific biological studies.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing is a critical determinant of genome complexity and, by implication, is assumed to engender proteomic diversity. This notion has not been experimentally tested in a targeted, quantitative manner. Here, we have developed an integrative approach to ask whether perturbations in mRNA splicing patterns alter the composition of the proteome. We integrate RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) (to comprehensively report intron retention, differential transcript usage, and gene expression) with a data-independent acquisition (DIA) method, SWATH-MS (sequential window acquisition of all theoretical spectra-mass spectrometry), to capture an unbiased, quantitative snapshot of the impact of constitutive and alternative splicing events on the proteome. Whereas intron retention is accompanied by decreased protein abundance, alterations in differential transcript usage and gene expression alter protein abundance proportionate to transcript levels. Our findings illustrate how RNA splicing links isoform expression in the human transcriptome with proteomic diversity and provides a foundation for studying perturbations associated with human diseases.},

abstract = {Increasing evidence supports that cellular dysregulations in the degradative routes contribute to the initiation and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Autophagy and endolysosomal homeostasis need to be maintained throughout life as they are major cellular mechanisms involved in both the production of toxic amyloid peptides and the clearance of misfolded or aggregated proteins. As such, alterations in endolysosomal and autophagic flux, as a measure of degradation activity in these routes or compartments, may directly impact as well on disease-related mechanisms such as amyloid-$\beta$ clearance through the blood-brain-barrier and the interneuronal spreading of amyloid-$\beta$ and/or Tau seeds, affecting synaptic function, plasticity and metabolism. The emerging of several genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease that are functionally related to endocytic transport regulation, including cholesterol metabolism and clearance, supports the notion that in particular the autophagy/lysosomal flux might become more vulnerable during ageing thereby contributing to disease onset. In this review we discuss our current knowledge of the risk genes APOE4, BIN1, CD2AP, PICALM, PLD3 and TREM2 and their impact on endolysosomal (dys)regulations in the light of late-onset Alzheimer's disease pathology.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing of messenger RNA can generate a wide variety of mature RNA transcripts, and these transcripts may produce protein isoforms with diverse cellular functions. While there is much supporting evidence for the expression of alternative transcripts, the same is not true for the alternatively spliced protein products. Large-scale mass spectroscopy experiments have identified evidence of alternative splicing at the protein level, but with conflicting results. Here we carried out a rigorous analysis of the peptide evidence from eight large-scale proteomics experiments to assess the scale of alternative splicing that is detectable by high-resolution mass spectroscopy. We find fewer splice events than would be expected: we identified peptides for almost 64{\%} of human protein coding genes, but detected just 282 splice events. This data suggests that most genes have a single dominant isoform at the protein level. Many of the alternative isoforms that we could identify were only subtly different from the main splice isoform. Very few of the splice events identified at the protein level disrupted functional domains, in stark contrast to the two thirds of splice events annotated in the human genome that would lead to the loss or damage of functional domains. The most striking result was that more than 20{\%} of the splice isoforms we identified were generated by substituting one homologous exon for another. This is significantly more than would be expected from the frequency of these events in the genome. These homologous exon substitution events were remarkably conserved-all the homologous exons we identified evolved over 460 million years ago-and eight of the fourteen tissue-specific splice isoforms we identified were generated from homologous exons. The combination of proteomics evidence, ancient origin and tissue-specific splicing indicates that isoforms generated from homologous exons may have important cellular roles.},

abstract = {The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasing rapidly in the western world and is poised to have a significant economic and societal impact. Current treatments do not alter the underlying disease processes meaning new treatments are required if this imminent epidemic is to be averted. The clinical manifestations of AD are secondary to a substantial loss of cortical neurons. To be effective, neuroprotective strategies will need to be implemented prior to this cell loss. However, this requires the discovery of both pre-clinical markers to identify susceptible patients and the early pathogenic mechanisms to serve as therapeutic targets. Although the biomarkers and pathogenic mechanisms may overlap, it is likely that new approaches are required to identify novel elements of the disease. Transcriptomic analyses, that assume no a priori etiological hypotheses, promise much in elucidating the pathogenesis of complex diseases like AD. Microarrays are the most popular platform for transcriptomic analysis and have been applied across AD models, patient samples and postmortem brain tissue. The results of these studies have been largely discordant which could, to some extent, reflect the limitations of this probe-hybridization-based methodology. In comparison, whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) utilizes a highly efficient, next-generation DNA sequencing method with improved dynamic range and scope of transcript detection. RNA-Seq is not only highly suited to investigations of the genomically complex human brain tissue but it can potentially overcome technical issues inherent to case-control comparisons of postmortem brain tissue in neurodegenerative diseases. The volume of data generated by this platform looms as the major logistical hurdle and a systematic experimental approach will be required to maximise the detection of pathogenically relevant signals. Nevertheless, RNA-Seq looks set to deliver a quantum leap forward in our understanding of AD pathogenesis.},

The average onset age is 59.7 years among approximately 140 NIID cases consisting of mostly sporadic and several familial cases. By linkage mapping of a large NIID family with several affected members (Family 1), we identified a 58.1 Mb linked region at 1p22.1–q21.3 with a maximum logarithm of the odds score of 4.21. By long-read sequencing, we identified a GGC repeat expansion in the 5′ region of NOTCH2NLC (Notch 2 N-terminal like C) in all affected family members. Furthermore, we found similar expansions in 8 unrelated families with NIID and 40 sporadic NIID cases. We observed abnormal anti-sense transcripts in fibroblasts specifically from patients but not unaffected individuals. This work shows that repeat expansion in human-specific NOTCH2NLC, a gene that evolved by segmental duplication, causes a human disease.},

METHODS: In this prospective, longitudinal study, we analyzed data from 128 participants who underwent baseline clinical and cognitive assessments, brain imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood tests. We used the participant's age at baseline assessment and the parent's age at the onset of symptoms of Alzheimer's disease to calculate the estimated years from expected symptom onset (age of the participant minus parent's age at symptom onset). We conducted cross-sectional analyses of baseline data in relation to estimated years from expected symptom onset in order to determine the relative order and magnitude of pathophysiological changes. RESULTS: Concentrations of amyloid-beta (A$\beta$)(42) in the CSF appeared to decline 25 years before expected symptom onset. A$\beta$ deposition, as measured by positron-emission tomography with the use of Pittsburgh compound B, was detected 15 years before expected symptom onset. Increased concentrations of tau protein in the CSF and an increase in brain atrophy were detected 15 years before expected symptom onset. Cerebral hypometabolism and impaired episodic memory were observed 10 years before expected symptom onset. Global cognitive impairment, as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Clinical Dementia Rating scale, was detected 5 years before expected symptom onset, and patients met diagnostic criteria for dementia at an average of 3 years after expected symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: We found that autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease was associated with a series of pathophysiological changes over decades in CSF biochemical markers of Alzheimer's disease, brain amyloid deposition, and brain metabolism as well as progressive cognitive impairment. Our results require confirmation with the use of longitudinal data and may not apply to patients with sporadic Alzheimer's disease.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gene profiling of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has revealed broad gene expression deregulation compared to normal B cells. While many studies have interrogated well known and annotated genes in DLBCL, none have yet performed a systematic analysis to uncover novel unannotated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) in DLBCL. In this study we sought to uncover these lncRNAs by examining RNA-seq data from primary DLBCL tumors and performed supporting analysis to identify potential role of these lncRNAs in DLBCL.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We performed a systematic analysis of novel lncRNAs from the poly-adenylated transcriptome of 116 primary DLBCL samples. RNA-seq data were processed using de novo transcript assembly pipeline to discover novel lncRNAs in DLBCL. Systematic functional, mutational, cross-species, and co-expression analyses using numerous bioinformatics tools and statistical analysis were performed to characterize these novel lncRNAs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We identified 2,632 novel, multi-exonic lncRNAs expressed in more than one tumor, two-thirds of which are not expressed in normal B cells. Long read single molecule sequencing supports the splicing structure of many of these lncRNAs. More than one-third of novel lncRNAs are differentially expressed between the two major DLBCL subtypes, ABC and GCB. Novel lncRNAs are enriched at DLBCL super-enhancers, with a fraction of them conserved between human and dog lymphomas. We see transposable elements (TE) overlap in the exonic regions; particularly significant in the last exon of the novel lncRNAs suggest potential usage of cryptic TE polyadenylation signals. We identified highly co-expressed protein coding genes for at least 88 {\%} of the novel lncRNAs. Functional enrichment analysis of co-expressed genes predicts a potential function for about half of novel lncRNAs. Finally, systematic structural analysis of candidate point mutations (SNVs) suggests that such mutations frequently stabilize lncRNA structures instead of destabilizing them.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Discovery of these 2,632 novel lncRNAs in DLBCL significantly expands the lymphoma transcriptome and our analysis identifies potential roles of these lncRNAs in lymphomagenesis and/or tumor maintenance. For further studies, these novel lncRNAs also provide an abundant source of new targets for antisense oligonucleotide pharmacology, including shared targets between human and dog lymphomas.},

Schizophrenia is a common mental disorder that presents as a complex condition. Many factors, of genetic, epigenetic and environmental etiology, such as developmental abnormalities in myelination, synapses and neurotransmission, have been implicated in this disorder. Intriguingly, aberrant alternative splicing of genes related to neurodevelopment and neural function has been detected in schizophrenia and related disorders. In this review, we discuss the aberrant splicing of specific genes for each candidate cause of schizophrenia.

Interferon regulatory factor-8 (IRF-8), an important transcription factor of the IRF family, is highly restricted in microglia in brains. The expression pattern and function of IRF-8 in AD need to be elucidated in order to provide novel therapies for the treatment of AD. In this study, our results indicated that expression of IRF-8 is significantly elevated in the brains and microglia of AD transgenic model Tg2576 mice. Notably, in vitro cell culture and reporter luciferase assay show that A$\beta$1–40 treatment promotes expression of IRF-8 at the transcriptional level. Silencing of IRF-8 in microglia abolished A$\beta$1–40-induced elevation in typical activated microglia-related genes, including the microglial innate response receptor toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), the chemotaxis gene purinergic receptor P2Y12R, and the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1$\beta$. However, overexpression of IRF-8 exacerbated the elevated expression of these proteins. Finally, the JAK2/STAT-1 pathway was found to mediate A$\beta$1–40-induced elevation of IRF-8. Overall, this is the first time to report that IRF-8 is involved in microglial activation and neuroinflammation in AD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many studies have examined the role of APOE genotype in the development of dementia, specifically Alzheimer disease (AD). The APOE $\epsilon$4 allele (APOE4) is a risk factor for both clinical and neuropathologic AD whereas the APOE $\epsilon$2 allele (APOE2) seems to be protective. This would predict, even with advanced age, that APOE2 carriers would be less likely to have dementia and less likely to meet pathologic criteria for AD. METHODS: The first 85 genotyped participants from The 90+ Study to come to autopsy were included. All-cause dementia (using DSM-IV criteria) and AD (using National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria) diagnoses were made by consensus conference using all available information including neuropsychological testing, neurologic examination, and medical records. Neuropathologic examination included Braak and Braak staging for plaques and tangles and diagnosis of neuropathologic AD using National Institute on Aging-Reagan criteria. RESULTS: Across all genotypes, 58.5{\%} of subjects were diagnosed with clinical dementia (81{\%} of dementia was AD) and 50.0{\%} met neuropathologic criteria for AD. Compared to those with an APOE $\epsilon$3/$\epsilon$3 genotype (APOE3/3), APOE4 carriers were more likely to be diagnosed with dementia (odds ratio [OR] = 12.2, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 1.5-102.0), whereas APOE2 carriers were not (OR = 0.3, 95{\%} CI = 0.1-1.3). Surprisingly, both APOE4 (OR = 4.6, 95{\%} CI = 1.3-16.5) and APOE2 (OR = 7.8, 95{\%} CI = 1.5-40.2) carriers were more likely to meet neuropathologic criteria for AD than those with APOE3/3 genotype. CONCLUSIONS: In the oldest old, the presence of the APOE $\epsilon$2 allele (APOE2) was associated with a somewhat reduced risk of dementia, but paradoxically was associated with increased Alzheimer disease (AD) neuropathology. Therefore, oldest old APOE2 carriers may have some mechanism that contributes to the maintenance of cognition independently of the formation of AD pathology. {\textcopyright} 2009 AAN Enterprises, Inc.},

However, increasing evidences demonstrated that neuroinflammatory changes, including chronic microgliosis are key pathological components of AD. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, is constantly survey the microenvironment under physiological conditions. In AD, deposition of $\beta$-amyliod (A$\beta$) peptide initiates a spectrum of cerebral neuroinflammation mediated by activating microglia. Activated microglia may play a potentially detrimental role by eliciting the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1$\beta$, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$) influencing the surrounding brain tissue. Emerging studies have demonstrated that up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines play multiple roles in both neurodegeneration and neuroprotection. Understanding the pro-inflammatory cytokines signaling pathways involved in the regulation of AD is crucial to the development of strategies for therapy. This review will discuss the mechanisms and important role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the pathogenesis of AD, and the ongoing drug targeting pro-inflammatory cytokine for therapeutic modulation.},

Considerable evidence indicates that these transcripts act directly as functional RNAs rather than through an encoded protein product. However, a recent study of ribosome occupancy reported that many large intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs) are bound by ribosomes, raising the possibility that they are translated into proteins. Here, we show that classical noncoding RNAs and 50 UTRs show the same ribosome occupancy as lincRNAs, demonstrating that ribosome occupancy alone is not sufficient to classify transcripts as coding or noncoding. Instead, we define a metric based on the known property of translation whereby translating ribosomes are released upon encountering a bona fide stop codon. We show that this metric accurately discriminates between protein-coding transcripts and all classes of known noncoding transcripts, including lincRNAs. Taken together, these results argue that the large majority of lincRNAs do not function through encoded proteins.},

While many DERs annotated to non-exonic sequence (41.1{\%}), most were similarly regulated in cytosolic mRNA extracted from independent samples. The DERs were developmentally conserved across 16 brain regions and in the developing mouse cortex, and were expressed in diverse cell and tissue types. The DERs were further enriched for active chromatin marks and clinical risk for neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia. Lastly, we demonstrate quantitatively that these DERs associate with a changing neuronal phenotype related to differentiation and maturation.

abstract = {ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette transporter A1) is a major regulator of cholesterol efflux and high density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism. Mutations in human ABCA1 cause severe HDL deficiencies characterized by the virtual absence of apoA-I and HDL and prevalent atherosclerosis. Recently, it has been reported that the lack of ABCA1 causes a significant reduction of apoE protein level in the brain of ABCA1 knock-out (ABCA1-/-) mice. ApoE isoforms strongly affect Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology and risk. To determine further the effect of ABCA1 on amyloid deposition, we used APP23 transgenic mice in which the human familial Swedish AD mutant is expressed only in neurons. We demonstrated that the targeted disruption of ABCA1 increases amyloid deposition in APP23 mice, and the effect is manifested by an increased level of A$\beta$ immunoreactivity, as well as thioflavine S-positive plaques in brain parenchyma. We found that the lack of ABCA1 also considerably increased the level of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and exacerbated cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related microhemorrhage in APP23/ ABCA1-/- mice. Remarkably, the elevation in parenchymal and vascular amyloid in APP23/ABCA1-/- mice was accompanied by a dramatic decrease in the level of soluble brain apoE, although insoluble apoE was not changed. The elevation of insoluble A$\beta$ fraction in old APP23/ABCA1-/- mice, accompanied by a lack of changes in APP processing and soluble $\beta$-amyloid in young APP23/ABCA1-/- animals, supports the conclusion that the ABCA1 deficiency increases amyloid deposition. These results sugest that ABCA1 plays a role in the pathogenesis of parenchymal and cerebrovascular amyloid pathology and thus may be considered a therapeutic target in AD. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly. This brain neuropathology is characterized by a progressive synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss, which lead to decline in memory and other cognitive functions. Histopathologically, AD manifests via synaptic abnormalities, neuronal degeneration as well as the deposition of extracellular amyloid plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles. While the exact pathogenic contribution of these two AD hallmarks and their abundant constituents [aggregation-prone amyloid $\beta$ (A$\beta$) peptide species and hyperphosphorylated tau protein, respectively] remain debated, a growing body of evidence suggests that their development may be paralleled or even preceded by the alterations/dysfunctions in the endolysosomal and the autophagic system. In AD-affected neurons, abnormalities in these cellular pathways are readily observed already at early stages of disease development, and even though many studies agree that defective lysosomal degradation may relate to or even underlie some of these deficits, specific upstream molecular defects are still deliberated. In this review we summarize various pathogenic events that may lead to these cellular abnormalities, in light of our current understanding of molecular mechanisms that govern AD progression. In addition, we also highlight the increasing evidence supporting mutual functional dependence of the endolysosomal trafficking and autophagy, in particular focusing on those molecules and processes which may be of significance to AD.},

abstract = {With the advent of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and next-generation sequencing, more than 20 risk loci that affect Alzheimer's disease have been identified. These loci are estimated to explain about 28{\%} of the heritability of liability, 30{\%} of familial risk, and over 50{\%} of sibling recurrence risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. These estimates are high in comparison with those for other complex diseases for which more risk loci have been discovered, such as type 2 diabetes, which is mostly a result of the strong effect of APOE $\epsilon$4 and to a lesser extent the rare variant TREM2 p.Arg47His. The search for functionally relevant genetic variants in risk loci detected in GWAS has revealed that the genetic variations underlying Alzheimer's disease include common variants affecting expression and splicing, a functional intragenic copy number variation, and rare pathogenic variants in risk loci, some of which might lead to familial Alzheimer's disease. An understanding of the contribution of these variants to the development of Alzheimer's disease has several clinical implications, including enhancing diagnostic accuracy and providing targets for the development of novel treatments.},

Single-cell transcriptomics [single-cell RNA sequencing (SC-RNA-seq)] has an immense potential of uncovering the novel basis of human life. The well-known heterogeneity of cells at the individual level can be better studied by single-cell transcriptomics. Proper downstream analysis of this data will provide new insights into the scientific communities. However, due to low starting materials, the SC-RNA-seq data face various computational challenges: normalization, differential gene expression analysis, dimensionality reduction, etc. Additionally, new methods like 10× Chromium can profile millions of cells in parallel, which creates a considerable amount of data. Thus, single-cell data handling is another big challenge. This paper reviews the single-cell sequencing methods, library preparation, and data generation. We highlight some of the main computational challenges that require to be addressed by introducing new bioinformatics algorithms and tools for analysis.

abstract = {In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the accumulation and deposition of amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) peptides in the brain is a central event. A$\beta$ is cleaved from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by $\beta$-secretase and $\gamma$-secretase mainly in neurons. Although mutations in APP, PS1, or PS2 cause early-onset familial AD, ABCA7 encoding ATP-binding cassette transporter A7 is one of the susceptibility genes for late-onset AD (LOAD), in which its loss-of-function variants increase the disease risk. ABCA7 is homologous to a major lipid transporter ABCA1 and is highly expressed in neurons and microglia in the brain. Here, we show that ABCA7 deficiency altered brain lipid profile and impaired memory in ABCA7 knock-out (Abca7-/-) mice. When bred to amyloid model APP/PS1 mice, plaque burden was exacerbated by ABCA7 deficit. In vivo microdialysis studies indicated that the clearance rate of A$\beta$ was unaltered. Interestingly, ABCA7 deletion facilitated the processing of APP to A$\beta$ by increasing the levels of $\beta$-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) in primary neurons and mouse brains. Knock-down of ABCA7 expression in neurons caused endoplasmic reticulum stress highlighted by increased level of protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2$\alpha$ (eIF2$\alpha$). In the brains of APP/PS1;Abca7-/- mice, the level of phosphorylated extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) was also significantly elevated. Together, our results reveal novel pathways underlying the association of ABCA7 dysfunction and LOAD pathogenesis.},

abstract = {Neurexins are evolutionarily conserved presynaptic cell-adhesion molecules that are essential for normal synapse formation and synaptic transmission. Indirect evidence has indicated that extensive alternative splicing of neurexin mRNAs may produce hundreds if not thousands of neurexin isoforms, but no direct evidence for such diversity has been available. Here we use unbiased long-read sequencing of full-length neurexin (Nrxn)1$\alpha$, Nrxn1$\beta$, Nrxn2$\beta$, Nrxn3$\alpha$, and Nrxn3$\beta$ mRNAs to systematically assess how many sites of alternative splicing are used in neurexins with a significant frequency, and whether alternative splicing events at these sites are independent of each other. In sequencing more than 25,000 full-length mRNAs, we identified a novel, abundantly used alternatively spliced exon of Nrxn1$\alpha$ and Nrxn3$\alpha$ (referred to as alternatively spliced sequence 6) that encodes a 9-residue insertion in the flexible hinge region between the fifth LNS (laminin-$\alpha$, neurexin, sex hormone-binding globulin) domain and the third EGF-like sequence. In addition, we observed several larger-scale events of alternative splicing that deleted multiple domains and were much less frequent than the canonical six sites of alternative splicing in neurexins. All of the six canonical events of alternative splicing appear to be independent of each other, suggesting that neurexins may exhibit an even larger isoform diversity than previously envisioned and comprise thousands of variants. Our data are consistent with the notion that $\alpha$-neurexins represent extracellular protein-interaction scaffolds in which different LNS and EGF domains mediate distinct interactions that affect diverse functions and are independently regulated by independent events of alternative splicing.},

Isoform tests for DIE show better performance than exon tests. We detect hundreds of DIE events traceable to cell types, often corresponding to functionally distinct protein isoforms. Mostly, one cell type is responsible for brain-region specific DIE. However, for fewer genes, multiple cell types influence DIE. Thus, regional identity can, although rarely, override cell-type specificity. Cell types indigenous to one anatomic structure display distinctive DIE, e.g. the choroid plexus epithelium manifests distinct transcription-start-site usage.

abstract = {Alzheimer9s disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive accumulation of amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the neocortex. Recent studies have implicated a role for regulatory genomic variation in AD progression, finding widespread evidence for altered DNA methylation associated with neuropathology. To date, however, no study has systematically examined other types of regulatory genomic modifications in AD. In this study, we quantified genome-wide patterns of lysine H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) - a robust mark of active enhancers and promoters that is strongly correlated with gene expression and transcription factor binding - in entorhinal cortex samples from AD cases and matched controls (n = 47) using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by highly parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq). Across {\~{}}182,000 robustly detected H3K27ac peak regions, we found widespread acetylomic variation associated with AD neuropathology, identifying 4,162 differential peaks (FDR {\textless} 0.05) between AD cases and controls. These differentially acetylated peaks are enriched in disease-specific biological pathways and include regions annotated to multiple genes directly involved in the progression of A$\beta$ and tau pathology (e.g. APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, MAPT), as well as genomic regions containing variants associated with sporadic late-onset AD. This is the first study of variable H3K27ac yet undertaken in AD and the largest study investigating this modification in the entorhinal cortex. In addition to identifying molecular pathways associated with AD neuropathology, we present a framework for genome-wide studies of histone modifications in complex disease, integrating our data with results obtained from genome-wide association studies as well as other epigenetic marks profiled on the same samples.},

abstract = {Previous transcriptome studies observed disrupted cellular processes in late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), yet it is unclear whether these changes are specific to LOAD, or are common to general neurodegeneration. In this study, we address this question by examining transcription in LOAD and comparing it to cognitively normal controls and a cohort of "disease controls." Differential transcription was examined using RNA-seq, which allows for the examination of protein coding genes, non-coding RNAs, and splicing. Significant transcription differences specific to LOAD were observed in five genes: C10orf105, DIO2, a lincRNA, RARRES3, and WIF1. These findings were replicated in two independent publicly available microarray data sets. Network analyses, performed on 2,504 genes with moderate transcription differences in LOAD, reveal that these genes aggregate into seven networks. Two networks involved in myelination and innate immune response specifically correlated to LOAD. FRMD4B and ST18, hub genes within the myelination network, were previously implicated in LOAD. Of the five significant genes, WIF1 and RARRES3 are directly implicated in the myelination process; the other three genes are located within the network. LOAD specific changes in DNA methylation were located throughout the genome and substantial changes in methylation were identified within the myelination network. Splicing differences specific to LOAD were observed across the genome and were decreased in all seven networks. DNA methylation had reduced influence on transcription within LOAD in the myelination network when compared to both controls. These results hint at the molecular underpinnings of LOAD and indicate several key processes, genes, and networks specific to the disease.},

In addition to APOE, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of AD in AA samples have implicated ABCA7, COBL, and SLC10A2 as AA-AD risk genes. Previously, we identified by whole exome sequencing a small number of AA AD cases and subsequent genotyping in a large AA sample of AD cases and controls association of AD risk with a pair of rare missense variants in AKAP9. In this study, we performed targeted deep sequencing (including both introns and exons) of approximately 100 genes previously linked to AD or AD-related traits in an AA cohort of 489 AD cases and 472 controls to find novel AD risk variants. We observed association with an 11 base-pair frame-shift loss-of-function (LOF) variant in ABCA7 (rs567222111) for which the evidence was bolstered when combined with data from a replication AA cohort of 484 cases and 484 controls (OR = 2.42, p = 0.022). We also found association of AD with a rare 9 bp deletion (rs371245265) located very close to the AKAP9 transcription start site (rs371245265, OR = 10.75, p = 0.0053). The most significant findings were obtained with a rare protective variant in F5 (OR = 0.053, p = 6.40 × 10-5), a gene that was previously associated with a brain MRI measure of hippocampal atrophy, and two common variants in KIAA0196 (OR = 1.51, p {\textless} 8.6 × 10-5). Gene-based tests of aggregated rare variants yielded several nominally significant associations with KANSL1, CNN2, and TRIM35. Although no associations passed multiple test correction, our study adds to a body of literature demonstrating the utility of examining sequence data from multiple ethnic populations for discovery of new and impactful risk variants. Larger sample sizes will be needed to generate well-powered epidemiological investigations of rare variation, and functional studies are essential for establishing the pathogenicity of variants identified by sequencing.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe and incurable neurodegenerative disease, and the failure to find effective treatments suggests that the underlying pathology remains poorly understood. Due to its strong heritability, deciphering the genetic landscape of AD and related dementia (ADD) is a unique opportunity to advance our knowledge. We completed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (39,106 clinically AD-diagnosed cases, 46,828 proxy-ADD cases and 401,577 controls) with the most promising signals followed-up in 25,392 independent AD cases and 276,086 controls. We report 75 risk loci for ADD, including 42 novel ones. Pathway-enrichment analyses confirm the involvement of amyloid/Tau pathways, highlight the role of microglia and its potential interaction with APP metabolism. Numerous genes exhibited differential expression or splicing in AD-related conditions and gene prioritization implies EGFR signaling and TNF- pathway through LUBAC complex. We also generated a novel polygenic risk score strongly associated with the risk of future dementia or progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. In conclusion, by more than doubling the number of loci associated with ADD risk, our study offers new insights into the pathophysiological processes underlying AD and offers additional therapeutic entry-points and tools for translational genomics.},

abstract = {Background: The complicated cellular and biochemical changes that occur in brain during Alzheimer's disease are poorly understood. In a previous study we used an unbiased label-free quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomic approach to analyze these changes at a systems level in post-mortem cortical tissue from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AsymAD), and controls. We found modules of co-expressed proteins that correlated with AD phenotypes, some of which were enriched in proteins identified as risk factors for AD by genetic studies. Methods: The amount of information that can be obtained from such systems-level proteomic analyses is critically dependent upon the number of proteins that can be quantified across a cohort. We report here a new proteomic systems-level analysis of AD brain based on 6,533 proteins measured across AD, AsymAD, and controls using an analysis pipeline consisting of isobaric tandem mass tag (TMT) mass spectrometry and offline prefractionation. Results: Our new TMT pipeline allowed us to more than double the depth of brain proteome coverage. This increased depth of coverage greatly expanded the brain protein network to reveal new protein modules that correlated with disease and were unrelated to those identified in our previous network. Differential protein abundance analysis identified 350 proteins that had altered levels between AsymAD and AD not caused by changes in specific cell type abundance, potentially reflecting biochemical changes that are associated with cognitive decline in AD. RNA binding proteins emerged as a class of proteins altered between AsymAD and AD, and were enriched in network modules that correlated with AD pathology. We developed a proteogenomic approach to investigate RNA splicing events that may be altered by RNA binding protein changes in AD. The increased proteome depth afforded by our TMT pipeline allowed us to identify and quantify a large number of alternatively spliced protein isoforms in brain, including AD risk factors such as BIN1, PICALM, PTK2B, and FERMT2. Many of the new AD protein network modules were enriched in alternatively spliced proteins and correlated with molecular markers of AD pathology and cognition. Conclusions: Further analysis of the AD brain proteome will continue to yield new insights into the biological basis of AD.},

Here we used single-nucleus RNA-sequencing analysis to perform a comprehensive study of cell types in the middle temporal gyrus of human cortex. We identified a highly diverse set of excitatory and inhibitory neuron types that are mostly sparse, with excitatory types being less layer-restricted than expected. Comparison to similar mouse cortex single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets revealed a surprisingly well-conserved cellular architecture that enables matching of homologous types and predictions of properties of human cell types. Despite this general conservation, we also found extensive differences between homologous human and mouse cell types, including marked alterations in proportions, laminar distributions, gene expression and morphology.

abstract = {This study determined (a) the association between stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and overall gene expression change, and (b) brain regions of greatest vulnerability to transcriptional change as the disease progressed. Fifteen cerebrocortical sites and the hippocampus were examined in persons with either no cognitive impairment or neuropathology, or with only AD-associated lesions. Cases were stratified into groups of 7-19 based on the degree of cognitive impairment (clinical dementia rating scale, CDR); neurofibrillary tangle distribution and severity (Braak staging) or density of cerebrocortical neuritic plaque (NP; grouping by NP density). Transcriptional change was assessed by Affymetrix U133 mRNA microarray analysis. The results suggested that (a) gene expression changes in the temporal and prefrontal cortices are more closely related to disease severity than other regions examined; (b) more genes are down-regulated at any given disease severity stage than up-regulated; (c) the degree of gene expression change in a given regions depends on the disease severity classification scheme used; and (d) the classification of cases by CDR provides a more orderly gradient of gene expression change in most brain regions than Braak staging or NP grouping. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Whole transcriptome studies have become essential for understanding the complexity of genetic regulation. However, the conventionally applied short-read sequencing platforms cannot be used to reliably distinguish between many transcript isoforms. The Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) RS II platform is capable of reading long nucleic acid stretches in a single sequencing run. The pseudorabies virus (PRV) is an excellent system to study herpesvirus gene expression and potential interactions between the transcriptional units. In this work, non-amplified and amplified isoform sequencing protocols were used to characterize the poly(A+) fraction of the lytic transcriptome of PRV, with the aim of a complete transcriptional annotation of the viral genes. The analyses revealed a previously unrecognized complexity of the PRV transcriptome including the discovery of novel protein-coding and non-coding genes, novel mono- and polycistronic transcription units, as well as extensive transcriptional overlaps between neighboring and distal genes. This study identified non-coding transcripts overlapping all three replication origins of the PRV, which might play a role in the control of DNA synthesis. We additionally established the relative expression levels of gene products. Our investigations revealed that the whole PRV genome is utilized for transcription, including both DNA strands in all coding and intergenic regions. The genome-wide occurrence of transcript overlaps suggests a crosstalk between genes through a network formed by interacting transcriptional machineries with a potential function in the control of gene expression.},

abstract = {Objective: To examine the relationship between stereologic estimates of AD-related pathology and severity of cognitive deficits in brain aging. Background: Previous studies reported substantial contributions of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), amyloid deposits, and neuronal loss to the development of dementia. However, the prediction of cognitive status based on nonstereologic quantification of these measures has led to conflicting results. Such studies have measured densities, rather than absolute numbers, and most do not take into account the potential interaction between the above pathologic hallmarks in a global multivariate analysis. Methods: Clinicopathologic study in 22 elderly cases. Cognitive status assessed prospectively using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE); stereologic assessment of NFT, unaffected neurons, and total amyloid volume in the CA1 field of the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and area 9. Statistical analysis was performed using both univariate and multivariate linear regression models. Results: High total NFT counts but not amyloid volume were strongly associated with a lower number of unaffected neurons in all areas studied. A high proportion of variability in MMSE scores was explained by NFT and neuronal counts in the CA1 field (83{\%} and 85.4{\%}), entorhinal cortex (87.8{\%} and 83.7{\%}), and area 9 (87{\%} and 79{\%}); amyloid volume in the entorhinal cortex, but not in the CA1 field and area 9, accounted for 58.5{\%} of MMSE variability. Multivariate analyses showed that total NFT counts in the entorhinal cortex and area 9 as well as neuron numbers in the CA1 field were the best predictors of MMSE score. Conclusions: These new stereologic data indicate that neuronal pathology in hippocampal formation and frontal cortex closely reflects the progression of cognitive deficits in brain aging and AD. They also demonstrate that amyloid volume has no additional predictive value, in terms of clinicopathologic correlations, beyond its interaction with NFT.},

Methods: Based on the transcriptome sequencing data from human embryonic stem cells, we analyzed multiple data features of PacBio and ONT, including error pattern, length, mappability and technical improvements over previous platforms. We also evaluated their application to transcriptome analyses, such as isoform identification and quantification and characterization of transcriptome complexity, by comparing the performance of PacBio, ONT and their corresponding Hybrid-Seq strategies (PacBio+Illumina and ONT+Illumina). Results: PacBio shows overall better data quality, while ONT provides a higher yield. As with data quality, PacBio performs marginally better than ONT in most aspects for both long reads only and Hybrid-Seq strategies in transcriptome analysis. In addition, Hybrid-Seq shows superior performance over long reads only in most transcriptome analyses. Conclusions: Both PacBio and ONT sequencing are suitable for full-length single-molecule transcriptome analysis. As this first use of ONT reads in a Hybrid-Seq analysis has shown, both PacBio and ONT can benefit from a combined Illumina strategy.

Splicing profiles are particularly diverse in the brain, but it is difficult to accurately identify and quantify full-length isoforms using standard approaches. CACNA1C is a large gene that shows robust genetic associations with several psychiatric disorders and encodes multiple, functionally-distinct voltage-gated calcium channels via alternative splicing. We combined long-range PCR with nanopore sequencing to characterise the full-length coding sequences of the CACNA1C gene in human brain. We show that its splice isoform profile varies between brain regions and is substantially more complex than currently appreciated: we identified 38 novel exons and 83 high confidence novel isoforms, many of which are predicted to alter protein function. Our findings demonstrate the capability of long-read amplicon sequencing to effectively characterise human splice isoform diversity, while the accurate characterisation of CACNA1C isoforms will facilitate the identification of disease-linked isoforms.},

Landmark discoveries of mutations in the transactive response DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) and fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS) as causative of ALS and FTLD, combined with the abnormal aggregation of these proteins, have initiated a shifting paradigm for the underlying pathogenesis of multiple neurodegenerative diseases. TDP-43 and FUS/TLS are both RNA/DNA-binding proteins with striking structural and functional similarities. Their association with ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases is redirecting research efforts toward understanding the role of RNA processing regulation in neurodegeneration. {\textcopyright} The Author 2010.

abstract = {Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that is important for establishing and maintaining neuronal morphology. In addition to its role in normal cells, tau protein is involved in many neurodegenerative diseases, e.g. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia, as the main component of intraneuronal aggregates. Alternative splicing of tau gene in the brain can give rise to at least six protein variants. A causative role of skewed tau exon 10 inclusion has been defined in frontotemporal dementia; however, no link was established between the aberrant splicing of tau and AD. Here, we applied a single-molecule-based technology, polymerase colony or polony, to simultaneously monitor tau splicing variant and haplotype profile in sporadic AD and normal brains. We found that the coordinated expression of tau exons 2 and 10 is altered in AD. Additional investigations of cis and trans mechanisms of this observation revealed a decreased protein expression of a known tau splicing factor, htra2-beta-1 in AD, thereby implicating a trans mechanism. Our results demonstrate that dysregulation of combinatorial splicing might serve as a signature for aging-related diseases, and the polony assay could be widely adapted for the study of other tauopathies. Furthermore, splicing-based therapeutics is an emerging area of drug development, and a well-defined and quantitative assay for monitoring single-gene transcriptome will be relevant for such development.},

abstract = {The advent of second-generation sequencing and its application to RNA sequencing have revolutionized the field of genomics by allowing quantification of gene expression, as well as the definition of transcription start/end sites, exons, splice sites and RNA editing sites. However, due to the sequencing of fragments of cDNAs, these methods have not given a reliable picture of complete RNA isoforms. Third-generation sequencing has filled this gap and allows end-to-end sequencing of entire RNA/cDNA molecules. This approach to transcriptomics has been a “niche” technology for a couple of years but now is becoming mainstream with many different applications. Here, we review the background and progress made to date in this rapidly growing field. We start by reviewing the progressive realization that alternative splicing is omnipresent. We then focus on long-noncoding RNA isoforms and the distinct combination patterns of exons in noncoding and coding genes. We consider the implications of the recent technologies of direct RNA sequencing and single-cell isoform RNA sequencing. Finally, we discuss the parameters that define the success of long-read RNA sequencing experiments and strategies commonly used to make the most of such data.},

We identified 184 splice sites with non-canonical dinucleotides and U2/U12-like consensus sequences.We selected 10 of the herein identified U2/U12-like non-canonical splice site events and successfully validated 9 of them via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing. Analyses of the 184 U2/U12-like noncanonical splice sites indicate that 51{\%} of them are not annotated in GENCODE. In addition, 28{\%} of them are conserved in mouse and 76{\%} are involved in alternative splicing events, some of them with tissue-specific alternative splicing patterns. Interestingly, our analysis identified some U2/U12-like noncanonical splice sites that are converted into canonical splice sites by RNA A-to-I editing. Moreover, the U2/U12-like non-canonical splice sites have a differential distribution of splicing regulatory sequences, which may contribute to their recognition and regulation. Our analysis provides a high-confidence group of U2/U12-like non-canonical splice sites, which exhibit distinctive features among the total human splice sites.},

We identified 4535 and 4086 IR events in 2173 human and 1736 mouse genes, respectively. Quantitation of IR enabled the identification of differentially expressed genes that conventional exon-level approaches did not reveal. There were significant correlations of intron expression within innate immune genes, like HMBOX1, with AD in humans. Peptides with a high probability of translation from intron-retained mRNAs were identified using mass spectrometry. Further, we established AD-specific intron expression Quantitative Trait Loci, and identified splicing-related genes that may regulate IR.

Integrating transcription factor regulatory modules with Alzheimer's disease risk loci revealed drivers of cell-type-specific state transitions towards Alzheimer's disease. For example, transcription factor EB, a master regulator of lysosomal function, regulates multiple disease genes in a specific Alzheimer's disease astrocyte subpopulation.

In addition, ABCA1 has been reported to modulate $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) production in vitro. These observations raise the possibility that ABCA1 may play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. Here we report that the deficiency of ABCA1 does not affect soluble or guanidine-extractable A$\beta$ levels in Tg-SwDI/B or amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) mice, but rather is associated with a dramatic reduction in soluble apoE levels in brain. Although this reduction in apoE was expected to reduce the amyloid burden in vivo, we observed that the parenchymal and vascular amyloid load was increased in Tg-SwDI/B animals and was not diminished in APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, we observed an increase in the proportion of apoE retained in the insoluble fraction, particularly in the APP/PS1 model. These data suggested that ABCA1-mediated effects on apoE levels and lipidation influenced amyloidogenesis in vivo. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

However, plasma GFAP has not been investigated in cognitively normal older adults at risk of AD, based on brain amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) load. Cross-sectional analyses were carried out for plasma GFAP and plasma A$\beta$1–42/A$\beta$1–40 ratio, a blood-based marker associated with brain A$\beta$ load, in participants (65–90 years) categorised into low (A$\beta$−, n = 63) and high (A$\beta$+, n = 33) brain A$\beta$ load groups via A$\beta$ positron emission tomography. Plasma GFAP, A$\beta$1–42, and A$\beta$1–40 were measured using the Single molecule array (Simoa) platform. Plasma GFAP levels were significantly higher (p {\textless} 0.00001), and plasma A$\beta$1–42/A$\beta$1–40 ratios were significantly lower (p {\textless} 0.005), in A$\beta$+ participants compared to A$\beta$− participants, adjusted for covariates age, sex, and apolipoprotein E-$\epsilon$4 carriage. A receiver operating characteristic curve based on a logistic regression of the same covariates, the base model, distinguished A$\beta$+ from A$\beta$− (area under the curve, AUC = 0.78), but was outperformed when plasma GFAP was added to the base model (AUC = 0.91) and further improved with plasma A$\beta$1–42/A$\beta$1–40 ratio (AUC = 0.92). The current findings demonstrate that plasma GFAP levels are elevated in cognitively normal older adults at risk of AD. These observations suggest that astrocytic damage or activation begins from the pre-symptomatic stage of AD and is associated with brain A$\beta$ load.

Among several challenging obstacles that have not been resolved is the heterogeneity of chemotherapeutic agents employed and the several variations in the application of the technique. This disparity hinders the conduct of systematic meta-analyses or the design of randomized trials that would demonstrate a clear survival benefit. Embolization without chemotherapy (transcatheter arterial embolization- TAE) has often been categorized as a form of chemoembolization. In this procedure, an embolizing agent (e.g. gelfoam, polyvinyl alcohol, acrylic copolymer gelatin particles) is administered intra-arterially via catheter with the goal of completely occluding the tumor feeding vessels. These agents may produce different effects on vasculature, resulting in permanent or transient occlusion, by acting at different levels in the arterial system. Despite the extensive research that is available on hepatic embolization, the precise effects of embolization on tumor cells remain largely unknown. In fact, recent data suggest that hypoxia, generated by arterial embolization, may activate several genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), leading to compensatory angiogenesis and tumor growth. A direct link among the degree of embolization, tumor hypoxia, and the stimulation of new blood vessels has been suggested in a number of studies. Kobayashi et al. found that blood levels of VEGF were markedly increased in patients who had been treated with embolization. VEGF may also help in predicting treatment response and monitoring disease course after chemoembolization. Moreover, recent research has shown that tumor ischemia and hypoxia may also provide a mechanism for resisting apoptosis. Further, hypoxia has been associated with metastasis and poor-outcomes via an unclear mechanism. The formation of early revascularization after proximal and temporary embolization induced with gelfoam has also been described. It seems that the earlier the revascularization of the tumor occurs, the more incomplete the necrosis will be. An occlusion of more peripheral vessels generates a nearly complete tumor necrosis and current trends in interventional oncology seem to favor distal occlusion. TACE was introduced in 1977 by Dr. Yamada R., who first exploited hepatocellular carcinoma's preferential blood supply from the hepatic artery to deliver anti-tumor therapy, without damaging the surrounding liver parenchyma. A decade later, the observation that the injection of ethiodized oil (lipiodol), an iodinated ester derived from poppy-seed oil, can be selectively up-taken and retained by primary HCC and hepatic metastases of colonic and neuroendocrine tumors led to the enclosure of this compound as a main ingredient of the injected chemotherapeutic cocktail. Moreover, lipiodol was also found to effectively engage the chemotherapeutic agents, leading concurrently to embolization and tumor necrosis. Theoretically, embolization of the feeding vessel causes ischemia of the tumor, and when combined with chemotherapy, results in tumor necrosis. Surprisingly, only 44{\%} of large treated lesions demonstrate extensive necrosis in pathology, leading to further exploration of the underlying mechanisms responsible for tumor necrosis. Recent studies have shown that tumor ischemia and hypoxia up-regulate several molecular factors, such as the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), thereby preventing cell apoptosis and stimulating tumor growth. These observations should be further tested in the clinical setting so as to demonstrate the role of possible interactions between hypoxia and the effect of embolization during chemoembolization.},

abstract = {The apolipoprotein E $\epsilon$4 gene is the most important genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease, but the link between this gene and neurodegeneration remains unclear. Using array tomography, we analysed {\textgreater}50 000 synapses in brains of 11 patients with Alzheimer's disease and five non-demented control subjects and found that synapse loss around senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease correlates with the burden of oligomeric amyloid-$\beta$ in the neuropil and that this synaptotoxic oligomerized peptide is present at a subset of synapses. Further analysis reveals apolipoprotein E $\epsilon$4 patients with Alzheimer's disease have significantly higher oligomeric amyloid-$\beta$ burden and exacerbated synapse loss around plaques compared with apolipoprotein E $\epsilon$3 patients. Apolipoprotein E4 protein colocalizes with oligomeric amyloid-$\beta$ and enhances synaptic localization of oligomeric amyloid-$\beta$ by {\textgreater}5-fold. Biochemical characterization shows that the amyloid-$\beta$ enriched at synapses by apolipoprotein E4 includes sodium dodecyl sulphate-stable dimers and trimers. In mouse primary neuronal culture, lipidated apolipoprotein E4 enhances oligomeric amyloid-$\beta$ association with synapses via a mechanism involving apolipoprotein E receptors. Together, these data suggest that apolipoprotein E4 is a co-factor that enhances the toxicity of oligomeric amyloid-$\beta$ both by increasing its levels and directing it to synapses, providing a link between apolipoprotein E $\epsilon$4 genotype and synapse loss, a major correlate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. {\textcopyright} The Author (2012).

Revertant mosaicism(RM) is a naturally occurring phenomenon where the pathogenic effect of a germline mutation is corrected by a second somatic event. Development of healthy-looking skin due to RM has been observed in patients with various inherited skin disorders, but not in connexin-related disease. We aimed to clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms of suspected RM in the skin of a patient with keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome. The patient was diagnosed with KID syndrome due to characteristic skin lesions, hearing deficiency and keratitis. Investigation of GJB2 encoding connexin (Cx) 26 revealed heterozygosity for the recurrent de novo germline mutation, c.148G {\textgreater} A, p. Asp50Asn. At age 20, the patient developed spots of healthy-looking skin that grew in size and number within widespread erythrokeratodermic lesions. Ultradeep sequencing of two healthy-looking skin biopsies identified five somatic nonsynonymous mutations, independently present in cis with the p. Asp50Asn mutation. Functional studies of Cx26 in HeLa cells revealed co-expression of Cx26-Asp50Asn and wild-type Cx26 in gap junction channel plaques. However, Cx26-Asp50Asn with the second-site mutations identified in the patient displayed no formation of gap junction channel plaques. We argue that the second-site mutations independently inhibit Cx26-Asp50Asn expression in gap junction channels, reverting the dominant negative effect of the p. Asp50Asn mutation. To our knowledge, this is the first time RM has been reported to result in the development of healthy-looking skin in a patient with KID syndrome.},

Misfolded and aggregated proteins bind to pattern recognition receptors on microglia and astroglia, and trigger an innate immune response characterised by release of inflammatory mediators, which contribute to disease progression and severity. Genome-wide analysis suggests that several genes that increase the risk for sporadic Alzheimer's disease encode factors that regulate glial clearance of misfolded proteins and the inflammatory reaction. External factors, including systemic inflammation and obesity, are likely to interfere with immunological processes of the brain and further promote disease progression. Modulation of risk factors and targeting of these immune mechanisms could lead to future therapeutic or preventive strategies for Alzheimer's disease.},

This molecular diversity results from near-exhaustive combinatorial use of alternative splice insertions in Nrxn1$\alpha$ and Nrxn2$\alpha$. By contrast, Nrxn3$\alpha$ exhibits several highly stereotyped exon selections that incorporate novel elements for posttranscriptional regulation of a subset of transcripts. Complexity of Nrxn1$\alpha$ repertoires correlates with the cellular complexity of neuronal tissues, and a specific subset of isoforms is enriched in a purified cell type.

Forty-eight of these splice forms were identified for the first time. The distribution of alternatively spliced ER$\alpha$ mRNAs was brain area- and case-specific. The dominant negative deletion (del.) 7 isoform appeared to be the major splice variant. The average number of ER$\alpha$ splice forms per brain area was lower in AD cases compared with controls, although the incidence of large deletions with alternative usage of 5' and 3' splice sites inside exons was more frequent in AD female cases. Relative transcription levels of del 7 and del 2 (missing exon 2) variants were decreased in the temporal cortex of AD patients, whereas the expression of the wild type ER$\alpha$ mRNA did not change. Our data show that alternative splicing of ER$\alpha$ mRNA is diminished in the AD brain and more prominently in AD female cases. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The transcriptome of the preimplantation mouse embryo has been previously annotated by short-read sequencing, with limited coverage and accuracy. Here we utilize a low-cell number transcriptome based on the Smart-seq2 method to perform long-read sequencing. Our analysis describes additional novel transcripts and complexity of the preimplantation transcriptome, identifying 2280 potential novel transcripts from previously unannotated loci and 6289 novel splicing isoforms from previously annotated genes. Notably, these novel transcripts and isoforms with transcription start sites are enriched for an active promoter modification, H3K4me3. Moreover, we generate a more complete and precise transcriptome by combining long-read and short-read data during early embryogenesis. Based on this approach, we identify a previously undescribed isoform of Kdm4dl with a modified mRNA reading frame and a novel noncoding gene designated XLOC{\_}004958. Depletion of Kdm4dl or XLOC{\_}004958 led to abnormal blastocyst development. Thus, our data provide a high-resolution and more precise transcriptome during preimplantation mouse embryogenesis.},

abstract = {Background: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that may be genetic factors underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how these AD-associated SNPs (AD SNPs) contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease is poorly understood because most of them are located in non-coding regions, such as introns and intergenic regions. Previous studies reported that some disease-associated SNPs affect regulatory elements including enhancers. We hypothesized that non-coding AD SNPs are located in enhancers and affect gene expression levels via chromatin loops. Methods: To characterize AD SNPs within non-coding regions, we extracted 406 AD SNPs with GWAS p-values of less than 1.00 × 10-6 from the GWAS catalog database. Of these, we selected 392 SNPs within non-coding regions. Next, we checked whether those non-coding AD SNPs were located in enhancers that typically regulate gene expression levels using publicly available data for enhancers that were predicted in 127 human tissues or cell types. We sought expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) genes affected by non-coding AD SNPs within enhancers because enhancers are regulatory elements that influence the gene expression levels. To elucidate how the non-coding AD SNPs within enhancers affect the gene expression levels, we identified chromatin-chromatin interactions by Hi-C experiments. Results: We report the following findings: (1) nearly 30{\%} of non-coding AD SNPs are located in enhancers; (2) eQTL genes affected by non-coding AD SNPs within enhancers are associated with amyloid beta clearance, synaptic transmission, and immune responses; (3) 95{\%} of the AD SNPs located in enhancers co-localize with their eQTL genes in topologically associating domains suggesting that regulation may occur through chromatin higher-order structures; (4) rs1476679 spatially contacts the promoters of eQTL genes via CTCF-CTCF interactions; (5) the effect of other AD SNPs such as rs7364180 is likely to be, at least in part, indirect through regulation of transcription factors that in turn regulate AD associated genes. Conclusion: Our results suggest that non-coding AD SNPs may affect the function of enhancers thereby influencing the expression levels of surrounding or distant genes via chromatin loops. This result may explain how some non-coding AD SNPs contribute to AD pathogenesis.},

abstract = {How the human brain develops and adapts with its trillions of functionally integrated synapses remains one of the greatest mysteries of life. With tremendous advances in neuroscience, genetics, and molecular biology, we are beginning to appreciate the scope of this complexity and define some of the parameters of the systems that make it possible. These same tools are also leading to advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders. Like the substrate for these problems, the etiology is usually complex-involving an array of genetic and environmental influences. To resolve these influences and derive better interventions, we need to reveal every aspect of this complexity and model their interactions and define the systems and their regulatory structure. This is particularly important at the tissue-specific molecular interface between the underlying genetic and environmental influence defined by the transcriptome. Recent advances in transcriptome analysis facilitated by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) can provide unprecedented insight into the functional genomics of neurological disorders. In this review, we outline the advantages of this approach and highlight some early application of this technology in the investigation of the neuropathology of schizophrenia. Recent progress of RNA-Seq studies in schizophrenia has shown that there is extraordinary transcriptome dynamics with significant levels of alternative splicing. These studies only scratch the surface of this complexity and therefore future studies with greater depth and samples size will be vital to fully explore transcriptional diversity and its underlying influences in schizophrenia and provide the basis for new biomarkers and improved treatments. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The detailed protein composition of the paired helical filaments (PHF) that accumulate in human neurons in aging and Alzheimer disease is unknown. However, the identity of certain components has been surmised by using immunocytochemical techniques. Whereas PHF share epitopes with neurofilament proteins and microtubule-associated protein (MAP) 2, we report evidence that the MAP tau ($\tau$) appears to be their major antigenic component. Immunization of rabbits with NaDodSO4-extracted, partially purified PHF (free of normal cytoskeletal elements, including $\tau$) consistently produces antibodies to $\tau$ but not, for example, to neurofilaments. Such PHF antibodies label all of the heterogeneous fetal and mature forms of $\tau$ from rat and human brain. Absorption of PHF antisera with heat-stable MAPs (rich in $\tau$) results in almost complete loss of staining of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in human brain sections. An affinity-purified antibody to $\tau$ specifically labels NFT and the neurites of senile plaques in human brain sections as well as NaDodSO4-extracted NFT. $\tau$-Immunoreactive NFT frequently extend into the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons, suggesting and aberrant intracellular locus for this axonal protein. $\tau$ and PHF antibodies label $\tau$ proteins identically on electrophoretic transfer blots and stain the gel-excluded protein representing NaDodSO4-insoluble PHF in homogenates of human brain. The progressive accumulation of altered $\tau$ protein in neurons in Alzheimer disease may result in instability of microtubules, consequent loss of effective transport of molecules and organelles, and, ultimately, neuronal death.},

Since the advent of second-generation sequencing technologies, a large number of RNA sequencing studies have considerably improved our understanding of transcriptome complexity.

In the present study we employ PacBio single-molecule long-read sequencing technology for whole-transcriptome profiling in rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). We totally obtain 36,186 high-confidence transcripts from 14,474 genic loci, among which more than 23{\%} of genic loci and 66{\%} of isoforms have not been annotated yet within the current reference genome. Furthermore, about 17{\%} of transcripts are computationally revealed to be non-coding RNAs. Up to 24,797 alternative splicing (AS) and 11,184 alternative polyadenylation (APA) events are detected within this de novo constructed transcriptome, respectively. The results provide a comprehensive set of reference transcripts and hence contribute to the improved annotation of rabbit genome.},

abstract = {Elevated levels of $\beta$-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) were found in the brain of some sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients; however, the underlying mechanism is unknown. BACE1 cleaves $\beta$-amyloid precursor protein (APP) to generate amyloid $\beta$ protein (A$\beta$), a central component of neuritic plaques in AD brains. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-$\kappa$B) signalling plays an important role in gene regulation and is implicated in inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis. In this report we found that both BACE1 and NF-$\kappa$B p65 levels were significantly increased in the brains of AD patients. Two functional NF-$\kappa$B-binding elements were identified in the human BACE1 promoter region. We found that NF-$\kappa$B p65 expression resulted in increased BACE1 promoter activity and BACE1 transcription, while disruption of NF-$\kappa$B p65 decreased BACE1 gene expression in p65 knockout (RelA-knockout) cells. In addition, NF-$\kappa$B p65 expression leads to up-regulated $\beta$-secretase cleavage and A$\beta$ production, while non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibited BACE1 transcriptional activation induced by strong NF-$\kappa$B activator tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-$\alpha$). Taken together, our results clearly demonstrate that NF-$\kappa$B signalling facilitates BACE1 gene expression and APP processing, and increased BACE1 expression mediated by NF-$\kappa$B signalling in the brain could be one of the novel molecular mechanisms underlying the development of AD in some sporadic cases. Furthermore, NSAIDs could block the inflammation-induced BACE1 transcription and A$\beta$ production. Our study suggests that inhibition of NF-$\kappa$B-mediated BACE1 expression may be a valuable drug target for AD therapy. {\textcopyright} 2011 CINP.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies have been successful in identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with a large number of phenotypes. However, an associated SNP is likely part of a larger region of linkage disequilibrium. This makes it difficult to precisely identify the SNPs that have a biological link with the phenotype. We have systematically investigated the association of multiple types of ENCODE data with disease-associated SNPs and show that there is significant enrichment for functional SNPs among the currently identified associations. This enrichment is strongest when integrating multiple sources of functional information and when highest confidence disease-associated SNPs are used. We propose an approach that integrates multiple types of functional data generated by the ENCODE Consortium to help identify “functional SNPs” that may be associated with the disease phenotype. Our approach generates putative functional annotations for up to 80{\%} of all previously reported associations. We show that for most associations, the functional SNP most strongly supported by experimental evidence is a SNP in linkage disequilibrium with the reported association rather than the reported SNP itself. Our results show that the experimental data sets generated by the ENCODE Consortium can be successfully used to suggest functional hypotheses for variants associated with diseases and other phenotypes.},

abstract = {Analyzing vertebrate genomes requires rapid mRNA/DNA and cross-species protein alignments. A new tool, BLAT, is more accurate and 500 times faster than popular existing tools for mRNA/DNA alignments and 50 times faster for protein alignments at sensitivity settings typically used when comparing vertebrate sequences. BLAT's speed stems from an index of all nonoverlapping K-mers in the genome. This index fits inside the RAM of inexpensive computers, and need only be computed once for each genome assembly. BLAT has several major stages. It uses the index to find regions in the genome likely to be homologous to the query sequence. It performs an alignment between homologous regions. It stitches together these aligned regions (often exons) into larger alignments (typically genes). Finally, BLAT revisits small internal exons possibly missed at the first stage and adjusts large gap boundaries that have canonical splice sites where feasible. This paper describes how BLAT was optimized. Effects on speed and sensitivity are explored for various K-mer sizes, mismatch schemes, and number of required index matches. BLAT is compared with other alignment programs on various test sets and then used in several genome-wide applications. http://genome.ucsc.edu hosts a web-based BLAT server for the human genome.},

This high-resolution analysis accounted for systematic differences in age, postmortem interval, brain pH, and reference gene expression, and it estimated the effect of disease on mRNA levels, on top of the effect of all other variables. Differential expression was confirmed for eight out of ten genes. Among them, Type B inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase (ITPKB), and regulator of G protein signaling 4 (RGS4) showed highly altered expression levels in patients (P values {\textless} 0.0001). Our results point towards increased inositol triphospate (IP3)-mediated calcium signaling in Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {The $\epsilon$4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although there have been numerous studies attempting to elucidate the underlying mechanism for this increased risk, how apoE4 influences AD onset and progression has yet to be proven. However, prevailing evidence suggests that the differential effects of apoE isoforms on A$\beta$ aggregation and clearance play the major role in AD pathogenesis. Other potential mechanisms, such as the differential modulation of neurotoxicity and tau phosphorylation by apoE isoforms as well as its role in synaptic plasticity and neuroinflammation, have not been ruled out. Inconsistent results among studies have made it difficult to define whether the APOE $\epsilon$4 allele represents a gain of toxic function, a loss of neuroprotective function, or both. Therapeutic strategies based on apoE propose to reduce the toxic effects of apoE4 or to restore the physiological, protective functions of apoE. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Background: Deregulated gene expression is a hallmark of cancer; however, most studies to date have analyzed short-read RNA sequencing data with inherent limitations. Here, we combine PacBio long-read isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) and Illumina paired-end short-read RNA sequencing to comprehensively survey the transcriptome of gastric cancer (GC), a leading cause of global cancer mortality. Results: We performed full-length transcriptome analysis across 10 GC cell lines covering four major GC molecular subtypes (chromosomal unstable, Epstein-Barr positive, genome stable and microsatellite unstable). We identify 60,239 non-redundant full-length transcripts, of which {\textgreater} 66{\%} are novel compared to current transcriptome databases. Novel isoforms are more likely to be cell line and subtype specific, expressed at lower levels with larger number of exons, with longer isoform/coding sequence lengths. Most novel isoforms utilize an alternate first exon, and compared to other alternative splicing categories, are expressed at higher levels and exhibit higher variability. Collectively, we observe alternate promoter usage in 25{\%} of detected genes, with the majority (84.2{\%}) of known/novel promoter pairs exhibiting potential changes in their coding sequences. Mapping these alternate promoters to TCGA GC samples, we identify several cancer-associated isoforms, including novel variants of oncogenes. Tumor-specific transcript isoforms tend to alter protein coding sequences to a larger extent than other isoforms. Analysis of outcome data suggests that novel isoforms may impart additional prognostic information. Conclusions: Our results provide a rich resource of full-length transcriptome data for deeper studies of GC and other gastrointestinal malignancies.},

abstract = {To develop targeted intervention strategies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, we first need to identify early markers of brain changes that occur before the onset of cognitive impairment. Here, we examine changes in resting-state brain function in humans from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. We compared longitudinal changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), assessed by (15)O-water PET, over a mean 7 year period between participants who eventually developed cognitive impairment (n = 22) and those who remained cognitively normal (n = 99). Annual PET assessments began an average of 11 years before the onset of cognitive impairment in the subsequently impaired group, so all participants were cognitively normal during the scanning interval. A voxel-based mixed model analysis was used to compare groups with and without subsequent impairment. Participants with subsequent impairment showed significantly greater longitudinal rCBF increases in orbitofrontal, medial frontal, and anterior cingulate regions, and greater longitudinal decreases in parietal, temporal, and thalamic regions compared with those who maintained cognitive health. These changes were linear in nature and were not influenced by longitudinal changes in regional tissue volume. Although all participants were cognitively normal during the scanning interval, most of the accelerated rCBF changes seen in the subsequently impaired group occurred within regions thought to be critical for the maintenance of cognitive function. These changes also occurred within regions that show early accumulation of pathology in Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that there may be a connection between early pathologic change and early changes in brain function.},

abstract = {Recent RNA-seq technology revealed thousands of splicing events that are under rapid evolution in primates, whereas the reliability of these events, as well as their combination on the isoform level, have not been adequately addressed due to its limited sequencing length. Here, we performed comparative transcriptome analyses in human and rhesus macaque cerebellum using single molecule long-read sequencing (Iso-seq) and matched RNA-seq. Besides 359 million RNA-seq reads, 4,165,527 Iso-seq reads were generated with a mean length of 14,875 bp, covering 11,466 human genes, and 10,159 macaque genes. With Iso-seq data, we substantially expanded the repertoire of alternative RNA processing events in primates, and found that intron retention and alternative polyadenylation are surprisingly more prevalent in primates than previously estimated. We then investigated the combinatorial mode of these alternative events at the whole-transcript level, and found that the combination of these events is largely independent along the transcript, leading to thousands of novel isoforms missed by current annotations. Notably, these novel isoforms are selectively constrained in general, and 1,119 isoforms have even higher expression than the previously annotated major isoforms in human, indicating that the complexity of the human transcriptome is still significantly underestimated. Comparative transcriptome analysis further revealed 502 genes encoding selectively constrained, lineage-specific isoforms in human but not in rhesus macaque, linking them to some lineage-specific functions. Overall, we propose that the independent combination of alternative RNA processing events has contributed to complex isoform evolution in primates, which provides a new foundation for the study of phenotypic difference among primates.},

In an autopsy series of brains of late-onset AD patients, we found a strong association of APOE4 allele with increased vascular and plaque A$\beta$ deposits.

The discovery of increased levels of inflammatory markers in patients with AD and the identification of AD risk genes associated with innate immune functions suggest that neuroinflammation has a prominent role in the pathogenesis of AD. In this Review, we discuss the interrelationships between neuroinflammation and amyloid and tau pathologies as well as the effect of neuroinflammation on the disease trajectory in AD. We specifically focus on microglia as major players in neuroinflammation and discuss the spatial and temporal variations in microglial phenotypes that are observed under different conditions.

abstract = {Apolipoprotein E (apoE) genotype has a major influence on the risk for Alzheimer disease (AD). Different apoE isoforms may alter AD pathogenesis via their interactions with the amyloid $\beta$-peptide (A$\beta$). Mice lacking the lipid transporter ABCA1 were found to have markedly decreased levels and lipidation of apoE in the central nervous system. We hypothesized that if Abca1-/- mice were bred to the PDAPP mouse model of AD, PDAPP Abca1-/- mice would have a phenotype similar to that of PDAPP Apoe+/- and PDAPP Apoe-/- mice, which develop less amyloid deposition than PDAPP Apoe+/+ mice. In contrast to this prediction, 12-month-old PDAPP Abca-/- mice had significantly higher levels of hippocampal A$\beta$, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy was significantly more common compared with PDAPP Abca1+/+ mice. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) C-terminal fragments were not different between Abca1 genotypes prior to plaque deposition in 3-month-old PDAPP mice, suggesting that deletion of Abca1 did not affect APP processing or A$\beta$ production. As expected, 3-month-old PDAPP Abca1-/- mice had decreased apoE levels, but they also had a higher percentage of carbonate-insoluble apoE, suggesting that poorly lipidated apoE is less soluble in vivo. We also found that 12-month-old PDAPP Abca1 -/- mice had a higher percentage of carbonate-insoluble apoE and that apoE deposits co-localize with amyloid plaques, demonstrating that poorly lipidated apoE co-deposits with insoluble A$\beta$. Together, these data suggest that despite substantially lower apoE levels, poorly lipidated apoE produced in the absence of ABCA1 is strongly amyloidogenic in vivo. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this study was to provide an update on the role of the innate immune system and neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, with an emphasis on microglial receptors CD33 and TREM2. RECENT FINDINGS: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many Alzheimer's disease risk genes related to immune response and microglia including the phagocytic receptors CD33 and TREM2. Recent GWAS and pathway analyses emphasize the crucial role of the innate immune system and neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Disease-associated microglia have been characterized by TREM2-dependent upregulation of phagocytic and lipid metabolism genes. Impaired microglial phagocytosis results in amyloid beta (A$\beta$) accumulation leading to neuroinflammation that is the primary cause of neurodegeneration. CD33 and TREM2 modulate neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease and have emerged as therapeutic targets in Alzheimer's disease. Progress has been made to inhibit CD33 by gene therapy, small molecules or immunotherapy, and to increase TREM2 activity by immunotherapy. Finally, mAbs against CD33 and TREM2 have entered clinical trials and may reduce neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease brain. SUMMARY: Targeting neuroinflammation via CD33 inhibition and/or TREM2 activation may have important implications for neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease and may be an addition to monoclonal anti-A$\beta$ antibody treatments that remove plaques without reducing neuroinflammation.},

abstract = {Staphylococcus epidermidis is a significant opportunistic pathogen of humans. The ST2 lineage is frequently multidrug-resistant and accounts for most of the clinical disease worldwide. However, there are no publically available, closed ST2 genomes and pathogenesis studies have not focused on these strains. We report the complete genome and methylome of BPH0662, a multidrug-resistant, hospital-adapted, ST2 S. epidermidis, and describe the correlation between resistome and phenotype, as well as demonstrate its relationship to publically available, international ST2 isolates. Furthermore, we delineate the methylome determined by the two type I restriction modification systems present in BPH0662 through heterologous expression in Escherichia coli, allowing the assignment of each system to its corresponding target recognition motif. As the first, to our knowledge, complete ST2 S. epidermidis genome, BPH0662 provides a valuable reference for future genomic studies of this clinically relevant lineage. Defining the methylome and the construction of these E. coli hosts provides the foundation for the development of molecular tools to bypass restriction modification systems in this lineage that has hitherto proven intractable.},

abstract = {We used a collection of 708 prospectively collected autopsied brains to assess the methylation state of the brain's DNA in relation to Alzheimer's disease (AD). We found that the level of methylation at 71 of the 415,848 interrogated CpGs was significantly associated with the burden of AD pathology, including CpGs in the ABCA7 and BIN1 regions, which harbor known AD susceptibility variants. We validated 11 of the differentially methylated regions in an independent set of 117 subjects. Furthermore, we functionally validated these CpG associations and identified the nearby genes whose RNA expression was altered in AD: ANK1, CDH23, DIP2A, RHBDF2, RPL13, SERPINF1 and SERPINF2. Our analyses suggest that these DNA methylation changes may have a role in the onset of AD given that we observed them in presymptomatic subjects and that six of the validated genes connect to a known AD susceptibility gene network.},

abstract = {Motivation: Because of the advantages of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) over microarrays, it is gaining widespread popularity for highly parallel gene expression analysis. For example, RNA-Seq is expected to be able to provide accurate identification and quantification of full-length splice forms. A number of informatics packages have been developed for this purpose, but short reads make it a difficult problem in principle. Sequencing error and polymorphisms add further complications. It has become necessary to perform studies to determine which algorithms perform best and which if any algorithms perform adequately. However, there is a dearth of independent and unbiased benchmarking studies. Here we take an approach using both simulated and experimental benchmark data to evaluate their accuracy. Results: We conclude that most methods are inaccurate even using idealized data, and that no method is highly accurate once multiple splice forms, polymorphisms, intron signal, sequencing errors, alignment errors, annotation errors and other complicating factors are present. These results point to the pressing need for further algorithm development.},

abstract = {Whole transcriptome studies have become essential for understanding the complexity of genetic regulation. However, the conventionally applied short-read sequencing platforms cannot be used to reliably distinguish between many transcript isoforms. The Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) RS II platform is capable of reading long nucleic acid stretches in a single sequencing run. The pseudorabies virus (PRV) is an excellent system to study herpesvirus gene expression and potential interactions between the transcriptional units. In this work, non-amplified and amplified isoform sequencing protocols were used to characterize the poly(A+) fraction of the lytic transcriptome of PRV, with the aim of a complete transcriptional annotation of the viral genes. The analyses revealed a previously unrecognized complexity of the PRV transcriptome including the discovery of novel protein-coding and non-coding genes, novel mono- and polycistronic transcription units, as well as extensive transcriptional overlaps between neighboring and distal genes. This study identified non-coding transcripts overlapping all three replication origins of the PRV, which might play a role in the control of DNA synthesis. We additionally established the relative expression levels of gene products. Our investigations revealed that the whole PRV genome is utilized for transcription, including both DNA strands in all coding and intergenic regions. The genome-wide occurrence of transcript overlaps suggests a crosstalk between genes through a network formed by interacting transcriptional machineries with a potential function in the control of gene expression.},

abstract = {Risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), the most prevalent dementia, is partially driven by genetics. To identify LOAD risk loci, we performed a large genome-wide association meta-analysis of clinically diagnosed LOAD (94,437 individuals). We confirm 20 previous LOAD risk loci and identify five new genome-wide loci (IQCK, ACE, ADAM10, ADAMTS1, and WWOX), two of which (ADAM10, ACE) were identified in a recent genome-wide association (GWAS)-by-familial-proxy of Alzheimer's or dementia. Fine-mapping of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region confirms the neurological and immune-mediated disease haplotype HLA-DR15 as a risk factor for LOAD. Pathway analysis implicates immunity, lipid metabolism, tau binding proteins, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, showing that genetic variants affecting APP and A$\beta$ processing are associated not only with early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease but also with LOAD. Analyses of risk genes and pathways show enrichment for rare variants (P = 1.32 × 10−7), indicating that additional rare variants remain to be identified. We also identify important genetic correlations between LOAD and traits such as family history of dementia and education. Large genome-wide meta-analysis of clinically diagnosed late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) from 94,437 individuals identifies new LOAD risk loci and implicates A$\beta$ formation, tau protein binding, immune response and lipid metabolism.},

abstract = {To gain insight into ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) function and its potential role in AD pathology, we analyzed the expression of the cholesterol transporter ABCA1 in postmortem hippocampus from persons at different stages of dementia and AD associated neuropathology relative to cognitively intact normal donors by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot. In this study clinical dementia rating (CDR) scores were used as a measure of dementia severity, whereas, Braak neuropathological staging and neuritic plaque density were used as an index of the neuropathological progression of AD. Correlation analysis showed that ABCA1 mRNA expression was significantly elevated at the earliest recognizable stage of dementia compared to persons with intact cognition. ABCA1 mRNA was also positively correlated with Braak neuropathological stages and neuritic plaque density counts. Additionally, ABCA1 mRNA levels showed robust correlation with dementia severity even after controlling for the confounding contribution of accompanying neuropathological parameters to ABCA1 mRNA expression. Western blot analyses showed that the differential expression observed at the transcriptional level is also reflected at the protein level. Thus, our study provides transcriptional and translational evidence that the expression of ABCA1, a key modulator of cholesterol transport across the plasma membrane, is dysregulated in the AD brain and that this dysregulation is associated with increasing severity of AD, whether measured functionally as dementia severity or neuropathologically as increased neuritic plaque and neurofibrillary tangle density. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Dysregulation of alpha-synuclein expression has been implicated in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies, in particular Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Previous studies have shown that the alternatively spliced isoforms of the SNCA gene are differentially expressed in different parts of the brain for PD and DLB patients. Similarly, SNCA isoforms with skipped exons can have a functional impact on the protein domains. The large intronic region of the SNCA gene was also shown to harbor structural variants that affect transcriptional levels. Here, we apply the first study of using long read sequencing with targeted capture of both the gDNA and cDNA of the SNCA gene in brain tissues of PD, DLB, and control samples using the PacBio Sequel system. The targeted full-length cDNA (Iso-Seq) data confirmed complex usage of known alternative start sites and variable 3′ UTR lengths, as well as novel 5′ starts and 3′ ends not previously described. The targeted gDNA data allowed phasing of up to 81{\%} of the {\~{}}114 kb SNCA region, with the longest phased block exceeding 54 kb. We demonstrate that long gDNA and cDNA reads have the potential to reveal long-range information not previously accessible using traditional sequencing methods. This approach has a potential impact in studying disease risk genes such as SNCA, providing new insights into the genetic etiologies, including perturbations to the landscape the gene transcripts, of human complex diseases such as synucleinopathies.},

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of full-length transcripts using long reads has paved the way for the discovery of thousands of novel transcripts, even in very well annotated organisms as mice and humans. Nonetheless, there is a need for studies and tools that characterize these novel isoforms. Here we present SQANTI, an automated pipeline for the classification of long-read transcripts that computes over 30 descriptors, which can be used to assess the quality of the data and of the preprocessing pipelines. We applied SQANTI to a neuronal mouse transcriptome using PacBio long reads and illustrate how the tool is effective in readily describing the composition of and characterizing the full-length transcriptome. We perform extensive evaluation of ToFU PacBio transcripts by PCR to reveal that an important number of the novel transcripts are technical artifacts of the sequencing approach, and that SQANTI quality descriptors can be used to engineer a filtering strategy to remove them. By comparing our iso-transcriptome with public proteomics databases we find that alternative isoforms are elusive to proteogenomics detection and are abundant in major protein changes with respect to the principal isoform of their genes. A comparison of Iso-Seq over the classical RNA-seq approaches solely based on short-reads demonstrates that the PacBio transcriptome not only succeeds in capturing the most robustly expressed fraction of transcripts, but also avoids quantification errors caused by unaccounted 3?? end variability in the reference. SQANTI allows the user to maximize the analytical outcome of long read technologies by providing the tools to deliver quality-evaluated and curated full-length transcriptomes.

abstract = {The molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal death are poorly understood. One of the most widely used models to study neuronal death are cultured cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) which undergo apoptosis when switched from a medium containing depolarizing levels of potassium (HK) to a medium with low non-depolarizing levels of potassium (LK). Previously, other labs have used DNA microarray analysis to characterize gene expression changes in LK-treated CGNs. However, microarray analysis is only capable of measuring the status of known transcripts, and expression of low-abundance mRNAs is often not detected by the hybridization-based approach. We have used RNA-sequencing to conduct a more detailed and comprehensive analysis of gene expression changes in CGNs induced to die by LK treatment. RNA-seq investigates the status of both known transcripts as well as exploring new ones and is substantially more sensitive than the microarray approach. We have found that the expression of 4334 genes is significantly al...},

abstract = {In recent years, important progress has been made in uncovering genes implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Three causal genes have been identified in which mutations cause familial presenile AD: the amyloid precursor protein gene and the presenilin 1 and 2 genes. Additionally, the epsilon 4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene was shown to be a major risk factor for AD. Despite the genetic heterogeneity, all of these genes work through a common mechanism, i. e. increasing the amount and deposition of the amyloid beta peptide (A beta) in brain triggering AD-related neuronal degeneration. Therefore, the levels of A beta and of the factors involved in its production and deposition are important in the neuropathogenesis of AD. Regulation of transcription of AD genes might therefore be an important player in the neurodegenerative process. In this review, we describe the major features of transcriptional regulation of the known AD genes and the implications of variable expression levels on susceptibility to AD.},

abstract = {The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid 2 (TREM2) is an immune phagocytic receptor expressed on brain microglia known to trigger phagocytosis and regulate the inflammatory response. Homozygous mutations in TREM2 cause Nasu-Hakola disease, a rare recessive form of dementia. A heterozygous TREM2 variant, p.R47H, was recently shown to increase Alzheimer"s disease (AD) risk. We hypothesized that if TREM2 is truly an AD risk gene, there would be additional rare variants in TREM2 that substantially affect AD risk. To test this hypothesis,weperformed pooled sequencing ofTREM2 coding regions in 2082ADcases and 1648 cognitively normal elderly controls of European American descent. We identified 16 non-synonymous variants, six of which were not identified in previous AD studies. Two variants, p.R47H [P 5 9.17 3 1024, odds ratio (OR) 5 2.63 (1.44-4.81)] and p.R62H [P 5 2.36 3 1024, OR 5 2.36 (1.47-3.80)] were significantly associated with disease risk in single-variant analyses. Gene-based tests demonstrate variants in TREM2 are genome-wide significantly associated with AD [PSKAT-O 5 5.37 3 1027; OR 5 2.55 (1.80-3.67)]. The association of TREM2 variants withAD is still highly significant after excluding p.R47H [PSKAT-O 5 7.72 3 1025;OR 5 2.47 (1.62-3.87)], indicating that additional TREM2 variants affect AD risk. Genotyping in available family members of probands suggested that p.R47H (P 5 4.65 3 1022) and p.R62H (P 5 6.87 3 1023) were more frequently seen in AD cases versus controls within these families. Gel electrophoresis analysis confirms that at least three TREM2 transcripts are expressed in human brains, including one encoding a soluble form of TREM2.},

A critical step in RNA-seq data analysis is the alignment of partial transcript reads to a reference genome sequence. To assess the performance of current mapping software, we invited developers of RNA-seq aligners to process four large human and mouse RNA-seq data sets. In total, we compared 26 mapping protocols based on 11 programs and pipelines and found major performance differences between methods on numerous benchmarks, including alignment yield, basewise accuracy, mismatch and gap placement, exon junction discovery and suitability of alignments for transcript reconstruction. We observed concordant results on real and simulated RNA-seq data, confirming the relevance of the metrics employed.

Starting with 1 microgram human skeletal muscle poly(A)+ RNA, a cDNA library was constructed that contained 3 x 10(6) independent clones with an average insert size of 2 kb. Sequence analysis of 172 randomly selected clones showed that 77{\%} of cDNA clones corresponding to known genes contained intact open reading frames. The average length of complete open reading frames was 2.4 kb. Furthermore, 86{\%} of the full-length clones retained longer 5' UTR sequences than the longest 5' end deposited in the GenBank database. cDNA libraries generated using this method will be useful for accelerating the collection of mRNA 5' end sequence information, which is currently very limited in GenBank.},

abstract = {Background: Highly multiplexed assays for quantitation of RNA transcripts are being used in many areas of biology and medicine. Using data generated by these transcriptomic assays requires measurement assurance with appropriate controls. Methods to prototype and evaluate multiple RNA controls were developed as part of the External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC) assessment process. These approaches included a modified Latin square design to provide a broad dynamic range of relative abundance with known differences between four complex pools of ERCC RNA transcripts spiked into a human liver total RNA background. Results: ERCC pools were analyzed on four different microarray platforms: Agilent 1- and 2-color, Illumina bead, and NIAID lab-made spotted microarrays; and two different second-generation sequencing platforms: the Life Technologies 5500xl and the Illumina HiSeq 2500. Individual ERCC controls were assessed for reproducible performance in signal response to concentration among the platforms. Most demonstrated linear behavior if they were not located near one of the extremes of the dynamic range. Performance issues with any individual ERCC transcript could be attributed to detection limitations, platform-specific target probe issues, or potential mixing errors. Collectively, these pools of spike-in RNA controls were evaluated for suitability as surrogates for endogenous transcripts to interrogate the performance of the RNA measurement process of each platform. The controls were useful for establishing the dynamic range of the assay, as well as delineating the useable region of that range where differential expression measurements, expressed as ratios, would be expected to be accurate. Conclusions: The modified Latin square design presented here uses a composite testing scheme for the evaluation of multiple performance characteristics: linear performance of individual controls, signal response within dynamic range pools of controls, and ratio detection between pairs of dynamic range pools. This compact design provides an economical sample format for the evaluation of multiple external RNA controls within a single experiment per platform. These results indicate that well-designed pools of RNA controls, spiked into samples, provide measurement assurance for endogenous gene expression studies.},

These regulatory events at enhancers contribute to the specific gene expression programs that determine cell state and the potential for differentiation into new cell types. Although enhancer elements are known to be associated with certain histone modifications and transcription factors, the relationship of these modifications to gene expression and developmental state has not been clearly defined. Here we interrogate the epigenetic landscape of enhancer elements in embryonic stem cells and several adult tissues in the mouse. We find that histone H3K27ac distinguishes active enhancers from inactive/poised enhancer elements containing H3K4me1 alone. This indicates that the amount of actively used enhancers is lower than previously anticipated. Furthermore, poised enhancer networks provide clues to unrealized developmental programs. Finally, we show that enhancers are reset during nuclear reprogramming.},

abstract = {The apolipoprotein E (APOE) $\epsilon$4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset, sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). The APOE $\epsilon$4 allele markedly increases AD risk and decreases age of onset, likely through its strong effect on the accumulation of amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) peptide. In contrast, the APOE $\epsilon$2 allele appears to decrease AD risk. Most rare, early-onset forms of familial AD are caused by autosomal dominant mutations that often lead to overproduction of A$\beta$42 peptide. However, the mechanism by which APOE alleles differentially modulate A$\beta$ accumulation in sporadic, late-onset AD is less clear. In a cohort of cognitively normal individuals, we report that reliable molecular and neuroimaging biomarkers of cerebral A$\beta$ deposition vary in an apoE isoform-dependent manner. We hypothesized that human apoE isoforms differentially affect A$\beta$ clearance or synthesis in vivo, resulting in an apoE isoform-dependent pattern of A$\beta$ accumulation later in life. Performing in vivo microdialysis in a mouse model of A$\beta$-amyloidosis expressing human apoE isoforms (PDAPP/TRE), we find that the concentration and clearance of soluble A$\beta$ in the brain interstitial fluid depends on the isoform of apoE expressed. This pattern parallels the extent of A$\beta$ deposition observed in aged PDAPP/TRE mice. ApoE isoform-dependent differences in soluble A$\beta$ metabolism are observed not only in aged but also in young PDAPP/TRE mice well before the onset of A$\beta$ deposition in amyloid plaques in the brain. Additionally, amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein and A$\beta$ synthesis, as assessed by in vivo stable isotopic labeling kinetics, do not vary according to apoE isoform in young PDAPP/TRE mice. Our results suggest that APOE alleles contribute to AD risk by differentially regulating clearance of A$\beta$ from the brain, suggesting that A$\beta$ clearance pathways may be useful therapeutic targets for AD prevention.},

We sequenced total RNA from human brain and liver and found a large fraction of reads (up to 40{\%}) within introns. Intronic RNAs were abundant in brain tissue, particularly for genes involved in axonal growth and synaptic transmission. Moreover, we detected significant differences in intronic RNA levels between fetal and adult brains. We show that the pattern of intronic sequence read coverage is explained by nascent transcription in combination with co-transcriptional splicing. Further analysis of co-transcriptional splicing indicates a correlation between slowly removed introns and alternative splicing. Our data show that sequencing of total RNA provides unique insight into the transcriptional processes in the cell, with particular importance for normal brain development. {\textcopyright} 2011 Nature America, Inc.

abstract = {Several variants of the $\beta$ amyloid protein, differing only at their carboxy terminus ($\beta$1–39, $\beta$1–40,$\beta$1–42, and $\beta$1–43), have been identified as the major components of the cerebral amyloid deposits which are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. Kinetic studies of aggregation by three naturally occurring $\beta$ protein variants ($\beta$1–39, $\beta$1–40, $\beta$1–42) and four model peptides ($\beta$26–39, $\beta$26–40, $\beta$26–42, $\beta$26–43) demonstrate that amyloid formation, like crystallization, is a nucleation-dependent phenomenon. This discovery has practical consequences for studies of the $\beta$ amyloid protein. The length of the C-terminus is a critical determinant of the rate of amyloid formation (“kinetic solubility”) but has only a minor effect on the thermodynamic solubility. Amyloid formation by the kinetically soluble peptides (e.g., $\beta$1–39, $\beta$1–40, $\beta$26–39, $\beta$26–40) can be nucleated, or “seeded”, by peptides which include the critical C-terminal residues ($\beta$1–42,$\beta$26–42,$\beta$26–43,$\beta$34–42). These results suggest that nucleation may be the rate-determining step of in vivo amyloidogenesis and that $\beta$1–42 and/or $\beta$1–43, rather than $\beta$1–40, may be the pathogenic protein(s) in AD. {\textcopyright} 1993, American Chemical Society.

abstract = {Background The locus for familial cortical myoclonic tremor with epilepsy (FCMTE) has long been mapped to 8q24 in linkage studies, but the causative mutations remain unclear. Recently, expansions of intronic TTTCA and TTTTA repeat motifs within SAMD12 were found to be involved in the pathogenesis of FCMTE in Japanese pedigrees. We aim to identify the causative mutations of FCMTE in Chinese pedigrees. Methods We performed genetic linkage analysis by microsatellite markers in a five-generation Chinese pedigree with 55 members. We also used array-comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies (whole-exome sequencing, capture region deep sequencing and whole-genome sequencing) to identify the causative mutations in the disease locus. Recently, we used low-coverage (∼10×) long-read genome sequencing (LRS) on the PacBio Sequel and Oxford Nanopore platforms to identify the causative mutations, and used repeat-primed PCR for validation of the repeat expansions. Results Linkage analysis mapped the disease locus to 8q23.3-24.23. Array-CGH and NGS failed to identify causative mutations in this locus. LRS identified the intronic TTTCA and TTTTA repeat expansions in SAMD12 as the causative mutations, thus corroborating the recently published results in Japanese pedigrees. Conclusions We identified the pentanucleotide repeat expansion in SAMD12 as the causative mutation in Chinese FCMTE pedigrees. Our study also suggested that LRS is an effective tool for molecular diagnosis of genetic disorders, especially for neurological diseases that cannot be positively diagnosed by conventional clinical microarray and NGS technologies.},

Here we use single-molecule long-read sequencing technology from Pacific Biosciences to sequence the polyadenylated RNA complement of a pooled set of 20 human organs and tissues without the need for fragmentation or amplification. We show that full-length RNA molecules of up to 1.5 kb can readily be monitored with little sequence loss at the 5' ends. For longer RNA molecules more 5' nucleotides are missing, but complete intron structures are often preserved. In total, we identify ∼14,000 spliced GENCODE genes. High-confidence mappings are consistent with GENCODE annotations, but {\textgreater}10{\%} of the alignments represent intron structures that were not previously annotated. As a group, transcripts mapping to unannotated regions have features of long, noncoding RNAs. Our results show the feasibility of deep sequencing full-length RNA from complex eukaryotic transcriptomes on a single-molecule level.},

This module was enriched in AD genetic risk factors and in microglia and astrocyte protein markers associated with an anti-inflammatory state, suggesting that the biological functions it represents serve a protective role in AD.

abstract = {The recent development of third generation sequencing (TGS) generates much longer reads than second generation sequencing (SGS) and thus provides a chance to solve problems that are difficult to study through SGS alone. However, higher raw read error rates are an intrinsic drawback in most TGS technologies. Here we present a computational method, LSC, to perform error correction of TGS long reads (LR) by SGS short reads (SR). Aiming to reduce the error rate in homopolymer runs in the main TGS platform, the PacBio{\textregistered} RS, LSC applies a homopolymer compression (HC) transformation strategy to increase the sensitivity of SR-LR alignment without scarifying alignment accuracy. We applied LSC to 100,000 PacBio long reads from human brain cerebellum RNA-seq data and 64 million single-end 75 bp reads from human brain RNA-seq data. The results show LSC can correct PacBio long reads to reduce the error rate by more than 3 folds. The improved accuracy greatly benefits many downstream analyses, such as directional gene isoform detection in RNA-seq study. Compared with another hybrid correction tool, LSC can achieve over double the sensitivity and similar specificity.},

abstract = {SORLA is a neuronal sorting receptor implicated both in sporadic and familial forms of AD. SORLA reduces the amyloidogenic burden by two mechanisms, either by rerouting internalized APP molecules from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to prevent proteolytic processing or by directing newly produced A$\beta$ to lysosomes for catabolism. Studies in cell lines suggested that the interaction of SORLA with cytosolic adaptors retromer and GGA is required for receptor sorting to and from the TGN. However, the relevance of anterograde or retrograde trafficking forSORLAactivity in vivo remained largely unexplored. Here, we generated mouse models expressing SORLA variants lacking binding sites for GGA or retromer to query this concept in the brain. Disruption of retromer binding resulted in a retrograde-sorting defect with accumulation of SORLA in endosomes and depletion from the TGN, and in an overall enhanced APP processing. In contrast, disruption of the GGA interaction did not impact APP processing but caused increased brain A$\beta$ levels, a mechanism attributed to a defect in anterograde lysosomal targeting of A$\beta$. Our findings substantiated the significance of adaptormediated sorting for SORLA activities in vivo, and they uncovered that anterograde and retrograde sorting paths may serve discrete receptor functions in amyloidogenic processes.},

abstract = {Background: Basecalling, the computational process of translating raw electrical signal to nucleotide sequence, is of critical importance to the sequencing platforms produced by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Here, we examine the performance of different basecalling tools, looking at accuracy at the level of bases within individual reads and at majority-rule consensus basecalls in an assembly. We also investigate some additional aspects of basecalling: training using a taxon-specific dataset, using a larger neural network model and improving consensus basecalls in an assembly by additional signal-level analysis with Nanopolish. Results: Training basecallers on taxon-specific data results in a significant boost in consensus accuracy, mostly due to the reduction of errors in methylation motifs. A larger neural network is able to improve both read and consensus accuracy, but at a cost to speed. Improving consensus sequences ('polishing') with Nanopolish somewhat negates the accuracy differences in basecallers, but pre-polish accuracy does have an effect on post-polish accuracy. Conclusions: Basecalling accuracy has seen significant improvements over the last 2 years. The current version of ONT's Guppy basecaller performs well overall, with good accuracy and fast performance.

abstract = {Both aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are associated with widespread epigenetic changes, with most evidence suggesting global hypomethylation in AD. It is, however, unclear how these age-related epigenetic changes are linked to molecular aberrations as expressed in animal models of AD. Here, we investigated age-related changes of epigenetic markers of DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation in a range of animal models of AD, and their correlations with amyloid plaque load. Three transgenic mouse models, including the J20, APP/PS1dE9 and 3xTg-AD models, as well as Caribbean vervets (a non-transgenic non-human primate model of AD) were investigated. In the J20 mouse model, an age-related decrease in DNA methylation was found in the dentate gyrus (DG) and a decrease in the ratio between DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation was found in the DG and cornu ammonis (CA) 3. In the 3xTg-AD mice, an age-related increase in DNA methylation was found in the DG and CA1-2. No significant age-related alterations were found in the APP/PS1dE9 mice and non-human primate model. In the J20 model, hippocampal plaque load showed a significant negative correlation with DNA methylation in the DG, and with the ratio a negative correlation in the DG and CA3. For the APP/PS1dE9 model a negative correlation between the ratio and plaque load was observed in the CA3, as well as a negative correlation between DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) levels and plaque load in the DG and CA3. Thus, only the J20 model showed an age-related reduction in global DNA methylation, while DNA hypermethylation was observed in the 3xTg-AD model. Given these differences between animal models, future studies are needed to further elucidate the contribution of different AD-related genetic variation to age-related epigenetic changes.},

abstract = {ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 - ABCA1, is the most extensively studied transporter in human pathology. ABCA1 became a primary subject of research in many academic and pharmaceutical laboratories immediately after the discovery that mutations at the gene locus cause severe familial High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) deficiency and, in the homozygous form - Tangier disease. The protein is the major regulator of intracellular cholesterol efflux which is the initial and essential step in the biogenesis and formation of nascent HDL particles. The transcriptional regulation of ABCA1 by nuclear Liver X Receptors (LXR) provided a starting point for drug discovery and development of synthetic LXR ligands/ABCA1 activators for treatment of arteriosclerosis. A series of reports that revealed the role of ABCA1 in A$\beta$ deposition and clearance, as well as the possibility for association of some ABCA1 genetic variants with risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) brought a new dimension to ABCA1 research. The LXR-ABCA1-APOE regulatory axis is now considered a promising therapeutic target in AD, which includes the only proven risk factor for AD - APOE, at two distinct levels - transcriptional regulation by LXR, and ABCA1 controlled lipidation which can influence A$\beta$ aggregation and amyloid clearance. This review will summarize the results of research on ABCA1, particularly related to AD and neurodegeneration. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

abstract = {Tauopathies are defined by assembly of the microtubule associated protein tau into filamentous tangles and classified by the predominant tau isoform within these aggregates. The major isoforms are determined by alternative mRNA splicing of exon 10 generating tau with three (3R) or four (4R) {\~{}}32 amino acid imperfect repeats in the microtubule binding domain. In normal adult brains there is an approximately equimolar ratio of 3R and 4R tau which is altered by several disease-causing mutations in the tau gene. We hypothesized that when 4R and 3R tau isoforms are not at equimolar ratios aggregation is favored. Here we provide evidence for the first time that the combination of 3R and 4R tau isoforms results in less in vitro heparin induced polymerization than with 4R preparations alone. This effect was independent of reducing conditions and the presence of alternatively spliced exons 2 and 3 N-terminal inserts. The addition of even small amounts of 3R to 4R tau assembly reactions significantly decreased 4R assembly. Together these findings suggest that co-expression of 3R and 4R tau isoforms reduce tau filament assembly and that 3R tau isoforms inhibit 4R tau assembly. Expression of equimolar amounts of 3R and 4R tau in adult humans may be necessary to maintain proper neuronal microtubule dynamics and to prevent abnormal tau filament assembly. Importantly, these findings indicate that disruption of the normal equimolar 3R to 4R ratio may be sufficient to drive tau aggregation and that restoration of the tau isoform balance may have important therapeutic implications in tauopathies. {\textcopyright} 2010 Adams et al.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease1 is characterized by a widespread functional disturbance of the human brain. Fibrillar amyloid proteins are deposited inside neurons as neurofibrillary tangles2 and extracel-lularly as amyloid plaque cores2 and in blood vessels2. The major protein subunit (A4) of the amyloid fibril of tangles, plaques and blood vessel deposits is an insoluble, highly aggregating small polypeptide of relative molecular mass 4,5003-6. The same polypep-tide is also deposited in the brains of aged individuals with trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome)3,5,6. We have argued previously that the A4 protein is of neuronal origin and is the cleavage product of a larger precursor protein4,6. To identify this precursor, we have now isolated and sequenced an apparently full-length complementary DNA clone coding for the A4 polypeptide. The predicted precursor consists of 695 residues and contains features characteristic of glycosylated cell-surface receptors. This sequence, together with the localization of its gene on chromosome 21, suggests that the cerebral amyloid deposited in Alzheimer's disease and aged Down's syndrome is caused by aberrant catabolism of a cell-surface receptor. {\textcopyright} 1987 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of full-length transcripts using long reads has paved the way for the discovery of thousands of novel transcripts, even in very well annotated organisms as mice and humans. Nonetheless, there is a need for studies and tools that characterize these novel isoforms. Here we present SQANTI, an automated pipeline for the classification of long-read transcripts that computes over 30 descriptors, which can be used to assess the quality of the data and of the preprocessing pipelines. We applied SQANTI to a neuronal mouse transcriptome using PacBio long reads and illustrate how the tool is effective in readily describing the composition of and characterizing the full-length transcriptome. We perform extensive evaluation of ToFU PacBio transcripts by PCR to reveal that an important number of the novel transcripts are technical artifacts of the sequencing approach, and that SQANTI quality descriptors can be used to engineer a filtering strategy to remove them. By comparing our iso-transcriptome with public proteomics databases we find that alternative isoforms are elusive to proteogenomics detection and are abundant in major protein changes with respect to the principal isoform of their genes. A comparison of Iso-Seq over the classical RNA-seq approaches solely based on short-reads demonstrates that the PacBio transcriptome not only succeeds in capturing the most robustly expressed fraction of transcripts, but also avoids quantification errors caused by unaccounted 3?? end variability in the reference. SQANTI allows the user to maximize the analytical outcome of long read technologies by providing the tools to deliver quality-evaluated and curated full-length transcriptomes.

abstract = {The wide implementation of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has revolutionized the field of medical genetics. However, the short read lengths of currently used sequencing approaches pose a limitation for the identification of structural variants, sequencing repetitive regions, phasing of alleles and distinguishing highly homologous genomic regions. These limitations may significantly contribute to the diagnostic gap in patients with genetic disorders who have undergone standard NGS, like whole exome or even genome sequencing. Now, the emerging long-read sequencing (LRS) technologies may offer improvements in the characterization of genetic variation and regions that are difficult to assess with the prevailing NGS approaches. LRS has so far mainly been used to investigate genetic disorders with previously known or strongly suspected disease loci. While these targeted approaches already show the potential of LRS, it remains to be seen whether LRS technologies can soon enable true whole genome sequencing routinely. Ultimately, this could allow the de novo assembly of individual whole genomes used as a generic test for genetic disorders. In this article, we summarize the current LRS-based research on human genetic disorders and discuss the potential of these technologies to facilitate the next major advancements in medical genetics.},

abstract = {Our vision of DNA transcription and splicing has changed dramatically with the introduction of short-read sequencing. These high-throughput sequencing technologies promised to unravel the complexity of any transcriptome. Generally gene expression levels are well-captured using these technologies, but there are still remaining caveats due to the limited read length and the fact that RNA molecules had to be reverse transcribed before sequencing. Oxford Nanopore Technologies has recently launched a portable sequencer which offers the possibility of sequencing long reads and most importantly RNA molecules. Here we generated a full mouse transcriptome from brain and liver using the Oxford Nanopore device. As a comparison, we sequenced RNA (RNA-Seq) and cDNA (cDNA-Seq) molecules using both long and short reads technologies and tested the TeloPrime preparation kit, dedicated to the enrichment of full-length transcripts. Using spike-in data, we confirmed that expression levels are efficiently captured by cDNA-Seq using short reads. More importantly, Oxford Nanopore RNA-Seq tends to be more efficient, while cDNA-Seq appears to be more biased. We further show that the cDNA library preparation of the Nanopore protocol induces read truncation for transcripts containing internal runs of T's. This bias is marked for runs of at least 15 T's, but is already detectable for runs of at least 9 T's and therefore concerns more than 20{\%} of expressed transcripts in mouse brain and liver. Finally, we outline that bioinformatics challenges remain ahead for quantifying at the transcript level, especially when reads are not full-length. Accurate quantification of repeat-associated genes such as processed pseudogenes also remains difficult, and we show that current mapping protocols which map reads to the genome largely over-estimate their expression, at the expense of their parent gene.},

abstract = {Background: Genome-wide association studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have identified a number of significant risk loci, the majority of which lie in non-coding regions of the genome. The lack of causal alleles and considerable polygenicity remains a significant barrier to translation into mechanistic understanding. This includes identifying causal variants and the cell/tissue types in which they operate. A fuller understanding of the cell types and transcriptional networks involved in AD genetic risk mechanisms will provide important insights into pathogenesis. Methods: We assessed the significance of the overlap between genome-wide significant AD risk variants and sites of open chromatin from data sets representing diverse tissue types. We then focussed on macrophages and microglia to investigate the role of open chromatin sites containing motifs for specific transcription factors. Partitioned heritability using LDscore regression was used to investigate the contribution of specific macrophage and microglia transcription factor motif-containing open chromatin sites to the heritability of AD. Results: AD risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are preferentially located at sites of open chromatin in immune cells, particularly monocytes (z score = 4.43; corrected P = 5.88 × 10- 3). Similar enrichments are observed for macrophages (z score = 4.10; corrected P {\textless} 2.40 × 10- 3) and microglia (z score = 4.34, corrected P = 0.011). In both macrophages and microglia, AD risk variants are enriched at a subset of open chromatin sites that contain DNA binding motifs for specific transcription factors, e.g. SPI1 and MEF2. Genetic variation at many of these motif-containing sites also mediate a substantial proportion of AD heritability, with SPI1-containing sites capturing the majority of the common variant SNP-chip heritability (microglia enrichment = 16.28, corrected enrichment P = 0.0044). Conclusions: AD risk alleles plausibly operate in immune cells, including microglia, and are concentrated in specific transcriptional networks. Combined with primary genetic association results, the SPI1 and MEF2 transcriptional networks appear central to AD risk mechanisms. Investigation of transcription factors targeting AD risk SNP associated regulatory elements could provide powerful insights into the molecular processes affected by AD polygenic risk. More broadly, our findings support a model of polygenic disease risk that arises from variants located in specific transcriptional networks.},

The feeding behaviors of Coullana sp., Cletocamptus deitersi, Microarthridion littorale, and Pseudostenhelia wellsi were examined using C-14-radiotracer grazing experiments and gut-pigment analyses. In one grazing experiment, laboratory-cultured microalgae were labeled using (NaHCO3)-C-14 and injected into intact sediment cores to determine whether copepods were grazing on algae from the water column and/or at the sediment-water interface. In another grazing experiment, (NaHCO3)-C-14 was injected directly into sediment cores and grazing on C-14-labeled natural algae was measured. Fluorometric analyses of gut pigments were used to determine the recent feeding histories of copepods. Functional responses of copepod feeding to variation in sedimentary chlorophyll (chi) a concentrations were also used to discern interspecific differences in feeding. Coullana sp. grazed on microalgae from the water-column and at the sediment-water interface. C. deitersi grazed predominantly on microalgae from the sediment-water interface. Grazing on laboratory-cultured algae was minimal in M. littorale and I! wellsi, but grazing experiments with C-14-labeled natural algae and gut-pigment analyses indicated that these copepods grazed on microalgae in the field. However, a positive functional response to chi a concentrations by M, littorale and a lack of a functional response by P. wellsi suggest that these 2 species exploit algal resources differently. Collectively, our observations indicate that each copepod species examined exploits microalgal resources differently.},

Previous studies have shown that 5hmC is enriched in the brain, although little is known about its genomic distribution and how it differs between anatomical regions and individuals. In this study, we combine oxidative bisulfite (oxBS) treatment with the Illumina Infinium 450K BeadArray to quantify genome-wide patterns of 5hmC in two distinct anatomical regions of the brain from multiple individuals.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We identify 37,145 and 65,563 sites passing our threshold for detectable 5hmC in the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum respectively, with 23,445 loci common across both brain regions. Distinct patterns of 5hmC are identified in each brain region, with notable differences in the genomic location of the most hydroxymethylated loci between these brain regions. Tissue-specific patterns of 5hmC are subsequently confirmed in an independent set of prefrontal cortex and cerebellum samples.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first systematic analysis of 5hmC in the human brain, identifying tissue-specific hydroxymethylated positions and genomic regions characterized by inter-individual variation in DNA hydroxymethylation.

abstract = {BackgroundPsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) are projected to lead the global disease burden within the next decade. Several lines of evidence suggest that epigenetic- or genetic-mediated dysfunction is frequently present in these disorders. To date, the inheritance patterns have been complicated by the problem of integrating epigenomic and transcriptomic factors that have yet to be elucidated. Therefore, there is a need to build a comprehensive database for storing epigenomic and transcriptomic data relating to psychiatric disorders.DescriptionWe have developed the PD{\_}NGSAtlas, which focuses on the efficient storage of epigenomic and transcriptomic data based on next-generation sequencing and on the quantitative analyses of epigenetic and transcriptional alterations involved in psychiatric disorders. The current release of the PD{\_}NGSAtlas contains 43 DNA methylation profiles and 37 transcription profiles detected by MeDIP-Seq and RNA-Seq, respectively, in two distinct brain regions and peripheral blood of SZ, BP and non-psychiatric controls. In addition to these data that were generated in-house, we have included, and will continue to include, published DNA methylation and gene expression data from other research groups, with a focus on psychiatric disorders. A flexible query engine has been developed for the acquisition of methylation profiles and transcription profiles for special genes or genomic regions of interest of the selected samples. Furthermore, the PD{\_}NGSAtlas offers online tools for identifying aberrantly methylated and expressed events involved in psychiatric disorders. A genome browser has been developed to provide integrative and detailed views of multidimensional data in a given genomic context, which can help researchers understand molecular mechanisms from epigenetic and transcriptional perspectives. Moreover, users can download the methylation and transcription data for further analyses.ConclusionsThe PD{\_}NGSAtlas aims to provide storage of epigenomic and transcriptomic data as well as quantitative analyses of epigenetic and transcriptional alterations involved in psychiatric disorders. The PD{\_}NGSAtlas will be a valuable data resource and will enable researchers to investigate the pathophysiology and aetiology of disease in detail. The database is available at http://bioinfo.hrbmu.edu.cn/pd{\_}ngsatlas/.},

abstract = {While splicing differences between tissues, sexes and species are well documented, little is known about the extent and the nature of splicing changes that take place during human or mammalian development and aging. Here, using high-throughput transcriptome sequencing, we have characterized splicing changes that take place during whole human lifespan in two brain regions: prefrontal cortex and cerebellum. Identified changes were confirmed using independent human and rhesus macaque RNA-seq data sets, exon arrays and PCR, and were detected at the protein level using mass spectrometry. Splicing changes across lifespan were abundant in both of the brain regions studied, affecting more than a third of the genes expressed in the human brain. Approximately 15{\%} of these changes differed between the two brain regions. Across lifespan, splicing changes followed discrete patterns that could be linked to neural functions, and associated with the expression profiles of the corresponding splicing factors. More than 60{\%} of all splicing changes represented a single splicing pattern reflecting preferential inclusion of gene segments potentially targeting transcripts for nonsense-mediated decay in infants and elderly.},

abstract = {The importance of aberrant RNA processing in neurodegeneration is becoming increasingly clear; a recent example being the identification of the splicing factor TDP-43 as the major component of inclusions characteristic of a number of neurodegenerative conditions including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Due to the enormous diversity generated by alternative splicing and its importance in the nervous system, it is no surprise that defective alternative splicing in disease has been particularly well documented. However, in addition to splicing, other RNA processing events such as RNA editing, polyadenylation and mRNA stability are also disrupted in some neurological disorders. For instance: the editing efficiency of specific ionotropic receptors is reduced in ALS affecting ion permeability and the function of RNA-processing proteins is affected by their sequestration to trinucleotide repeat expanded mRNAs in several disorders. Due to the extensive coupling between RNA processing events and the multifunctionality of the RNA processing factors that regulate them, it is important to consider RNA processing as a whole. Here we review RNA processing events and their extensive coupling to one another and detail the associations of RNA processing including, but not exclusively, alternative splicing with neurodegeneration. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {While alternative splicing is known to diversify the functional characteristics of some genes, the extent to which protein isoforms globally contribute to functional complexity on a proteomic scale remains unknown. To address this systematically, we cloned full-length open reading frames of alternatively spliced transcripts for a large number of human genes and used protein-protein interaction profiling to functionally compare hundreds of protein isoform pairs. The majority of isoform pairs share less than 50{\%} of their interactions. In the global context of interactome network maps, alternative isoforms tend to behave like distinct proteins rather than minor variants of each other. Interaction partners specific to alternative isoforms tend to be expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner and belong to distinct functional modules. Our strategy, applicable to other functional characteristics, reveals a widespread expansion of protein interaction capabilities through alternative splicing and suggests that many alternative "isoforms" are functionally divergent (i.e., "functional alloforms").},

abstract = {Cell-to-cell variability in gene expression is important for many processes in biology, including embryonic development and stem cell homeostasis. While heterogeneity of gene expression levels has been extensively studied, less attention has been paid to mRNA polyadenylation isoform choice. 3' untranslated regions regulate mRNA fate, and their choice is tightly controlled during development, but how 3' isoform usage varies within genetically and developmentally homogeneous cell populations has not been explored. Here, we perform genome-wide quantification of polyadenylation site usage in single mouse embryonic and neural stem cells using a novel single-cell transcriptomic method, BATSeq. By applying BATBayes, a statistical framework for analyzing single-cell isoform data, we find that while the developmental state of the cell globally determines isoform usage, single cells from the same state differ in the choice of isoforms. Notably this variation exceeds random selection with equal preference in all cells, a finding that was confirmed by RNA FISH data. Variability in 3' isoform choice has potential implications on functional cell-to-cell heterogeneity as well as utility in resolving cell populations.},

Recent genome-wide association studies have shown that a rare R47H mutation of TREM2 correlates with a substantial increase in the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). To address the basis for this genetic association, we studied TREM2 deficiency in the 5XFAD mouse model of AD. We found that TREM2 deficiency and haploinsufficiency augment $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) accumulation due to a dysfunctional response of microglia, which fail to cluster around A$\beta$ plaques and become apoptotic. We further demonstrate that TREM2 senses a broad array of anionic and zwitterionic lipids known to associate with fibrillar A$\beta$ in lipid membranes and to be exposed on the surface of damaged neurons. Remarkably, the R47H mutation impairs TREM2 detection of lipid ligands. Thus, TREM2 detects damage-associated lipid patterns associated with neurodegeneration, sustaining the microglial response to A$\beta$ accumulation.},

abstract = {Hepatitis B virus (HBV) has a high mutation rate due to the extremely high replication rate and the proofreading deficiency during reverse transcription. The generated variants with genetic heterogeneity are described as viral quasispecies (QS). Clone-based sequencing (CBS) is thought to be the 'gold standard' for assessing QS complexity and diversity of HBV, but an important issue about CBS is cost-effectiveness and laborious. In this study, we investigated the utility of the third-generation sequencing (TGS) DNA sequencing to characterize genetic heterogeneity of HBV QS and assessed the possible contribution of TGS technology in HBV QS studies. Parallel experiments including 3 control samples, which consisted of HBV full gene genotype B and genotype C plasmids, and 10 patients samples were performed by using CBS and TGS to analyze HBV whole-genome QS. Characterization of QS heterogeneity was conducted by using comprehensive statistical analysis. The results showed that TGS had a high consistency with CBS when measuring the complexity and diversity of QS. In addition, to detect rare variants, there were strong advantages conferred by TGS. In summary, TGS was considered to be practicable in HBV QS studies and it might have a relevant role in the clinical management of HBV infection in the future.},

Our bioinformatic analyses of transcriptomic and proteomic data of normal white blood cell differentiation reveal IR as a physiological mechanism of gene expression control. IR regulates the expression of 86 functionally related genes, including those that determine the nuclear shape that is unique to granulocytes. Retention of introns in specific genes is associated with downregulation of splicing factors and higher GC content. IR, conserved between human and mouse, led to reduced mRNA and protein levels by triggering the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway. In contrast to the prevalent view that NMD is limited to mRNAs encoding aberrant proteins, our data establish that IR coupled with NMD is a conserved mechanism in normal granulopoiesis. Physiological IR may provide an energetically favorable level of dynamic gene expression control prior to sustained gene translation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Despite their success, the current diagnostic rate for genomic analyses across a variety of rare diseases is approximately 25 to 50{\%}. We explore the utility of transcriptome sequencing [RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)] as a complementary diagnostic tool in a cohort of 50 patients with genetically undiagnosed rare muscle disorders. We describe an integrated approach to analyze patient muscle RNA-seq, leveraging an analysis framework focused on the detection of transcript-level changes that are unique to the patient compared to more than 180 control skeletal muscle samples. We demonstrate the power of RNA-seq to validate candidate splice-disrupting mutations and to identify splice-altering variants in both exonic and deep intronic regions, yielding an overall diagnosis rate of 35{\%}. We also report the discovery of a highly recurrent de novo intronic mutation in COL6A1 that results in a dominantly acting splice-gain event, disrupting the critical glycine repeat motif of the triple helical domain. We identify this pathogenic variant in a total of 27 genetically unsolved patients in an external collagen VI-like dystrophy cohort, thus explaining approximately 25{\%} of patients clinically suggestive of having collagen VI dystrophy in whom prior genetic analysis is negative. Overall, this study represents a large systematic application of transcriptome sequenc-ing to rare disease diagnosis and highlights its utility for the detection and interpretation of variants missed by current standard diagnostic approaches.},

Our data showed that the clinical isolate HIV-1(89.6) produces at least 109 different spliced RNAs, including a previously unappreciated ∼1 kb class of messages, two of which encode new proteins. HIV-1 message populations differed between cell types, longitudinally during infection, and among T cells from different human donors.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Even though real-time PCR has been broadly applied in biomedical sciences, data processing procedures for the analysis of quantitative real-time PCR are still lacking; specifically in the realm of appropriate statistical treatment. Confidence interval and statistical significance considerations are not explicit in many of the current data analysis approaches. Based on the standard curve method and other useful data analysis methods, we present and compare four statistical approaches and models for the analysis of real-time PCR data. RESULTS: In the first approach, a multiple regression analysis model was developed to derive DeltaDeltaCt from estimation of interaction of gene and treatment effects. In the second approach, an ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) model was proposed, and the DeltaDeltaCt can be derived from analysis of effects of variables. The other two models involve calculation DeltaCt followed by a two group t-test and non-parametric analogous Wilcoxon test. SAS programs were developed for all four models and data output for analysis of a sample set are presented. In addition, a data quality control model was developed and implemented using SAS. CONCLUSION: Practical statistical solutions with SAS programs were developed for real-time PCR data and a sample dataset was analyzed with the SAS programs. The analysis using the various models and programs yielded similar results. Data quality control and analysis procedures presented here provide statistical elements for the estimation of the relative expression of genes using real-time PCR.},

The regions of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) are hierarchically involved in A$\beta$-deposition. Objective: To clarify whether there is a hierarchical involvement of the regions of the entire brain as well and whether there are differences in the expansion of A$\beta$-pathology between clinically proven AD cases and nondemented cases with AD-related pathology, the authors investigated 47 brains from demented and nondemented patients with AD-related pathology covering all phases of $\beta$-amyloidosis in the MTL (A$\beta$MTL phases) and four control brains without any AD-related pathology. Methods: A$\beta$ deposits were detected by the use of the Campbell-Switzer silver technique and by immunohistochemistry in sections covering all brain regions and brainstem nuclei. It was analyzed how often distinct regions exhibited A$\beta$ deposits. Results: In the first of five phases in the evolution of $\beta$-amyloidosis A$\beta$ deposits are found exclusively in the neocortex. The second phase is characterized by the additional involvement of allocortical brain regions. In phase 3, diencephalic nuclei, the striatum, and the cholinergic nuclei of the basal forebrain exhibit A$\beta$ deposits as well. Several brainstem nuclei become additionally involved in phase 4. Phase 5, finally, is characterized by cerebellar A$\beta$-deposition. The 17 clinically proven AD cases exhibit A$\beta$-phases 3, 4, or 5. The nine nondemented cases with AD-related A$\beta$ pathology show A$\beta$-phases 1, 2, or 3. Conclusions: A$\beta$-deposition in the entire brain follows a distinct sequence in which the regions are hierarchically involved. A$\beta$-deposition, thereby, expands anterogradely into regions that receive neuronal projections from regions already exhibiting A$\beta$. There are also indications that clinically proven AD cases with full-blown $\beta$-amyloidosis may be preceded in early stages by nondemented cases exhibiting AD-related A$\beta$ pathology.},

On the other hand, third-generation sequencing, which yields much longer reads, has current limitations of lower raw accuracy and throughput. Here, we combine second-generation sequencing and third-generation sequencing with a custom-designed method for isoform identification and quantification to generate a high-confidence isoform dataset for human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We report 8,084 RefSeq-annotated isoforms detected as full-length and an additional 5,459 isoforms predicted through statistical inference. Over one-third of these are novel isoforms, including 273 RNAs from gene loci that have not previously been identified. Further characterization of the novel loci indicates that a subset is expressed in pluripotent cells but not in diverse fetal and adult tissues; moreover, their reduced expression perturbs the network of pluripotency-associated genes. Results suggest that gene identification, even in well-characterized human cell lines and tissues, is likely far from complete.},

Comprehensive transcriptome analysis, including analysis of exon co-association in the same molecule, requires deep, long-read sequencing. Here we introduce an RNA sequencing method, synthetic long-read RNA sequencing (SLR-RNA-seq), in which small pools ([le]1,000 molecules/pool, [le]1 molecule/gene for most genes) of full-length cDNAs are amplified, fragmented and short-read-sequenced. We demonstrate that these RNA sequences reconstructed from the short reads from each of the pools are mostly close to full length and contain few insertion and deletion errors. We report many previously undescribed isoforms (human brain: [sim]13,800 affected genes, 14.5{\%} of molecules; mouse brain [sim]8,600 genes, 18{\%} of molecules) and up to 165 human distant molecularly associated exon pairs (dMAPs) and distant molecularly and mutually exclusive pairs (dMEPs). Of 16 associated pairs detected in the mouse brain, 9 are conserved in human. Our results indicate conserved mechanisms that can produce distant but phased features on transcript and proteome isoforms.},

abstract = {Background: RNA sequencing technologies have allowed researchers to gain a better understanding of how the transcriptome affects disease. However, sequencing technologies often unintentionally introduce experimental error into RNA sequencing data. To counteract this, normalization methods are standardly applied with the intent of reducing the non-biologically derived variability inherent in transcriptomic measurements. However, the comparative efficacy of the various normalization techniques has not been tested in a standardized manner. Here we propose tests that evaluate numerous normalization techniques and applied them to a large-scale standard data set. These tests comprise a protocol that allows researchers to measure the amount of non-biological variability which is present in any data set after normalization has been performed, a crucial step to assessing the biological validity of data following normalization. Results: In this study we present two tests to assess the validity of normalization methods applied to a large-scale data set collected for systematic evaluation purposes. We tested various RNASeq normalization procedures and concluded that transcripts per million (TPM) was the best performing normalization method based on its preservation of biological signal as compared to the other methods tested. Conclusion: Normalization is of vital importance to accurately interpret the results of genomic and transcriptomic experiments. More work, however, needs to be performed to optimize normalization methods for RNASeq data. The present effort helps pave the way for more systematic evaluations of normalization methods across different platforms. With our proposed schema researchers can evaluate their own or future normalization methods to further improve the field of RNASeq normalization.},

abstract = {Next generation sequencing (NGS) technology has revolutionized genomic and genetic research. The pace of change in this area is rapid with three major new sequencing platforms having been released in 2011: Ion Torrent's PGM, Pacific Biosciences' RS and the Illumina MiSeq. Here we compare the results obtained with those platforms to the performance of the Illumina HiSeq, the current market leader. In order to compare these platforms, and get sufficient coverage depth to allow meaningful analysis, we have sequenced a set of 4 microbial genomes with mean GC content ranging from 19.3 to 67.7{\%}. Together, these represent a comprehensive range of genome content. Here we report our analysis of that sequence data in terms of coverage distribution, bias, GC distribution, variant detection and accuracy. Sequence generated by Ion Torrent, MiSeq and Pacific Biosciences technologies displays near perfect coverage behaviour on GC-rich, neutral and moderately AT-rich genomes, but a profound bias was observed upon sequencing the extremely AT-rich genome of Plasmodium falciparum on the PGM, resulting in no coverage for approximately 30{\%} of the genome. We analysed the ability to call variants from each platform and found that we could call slightly more variants from Ion Torrent data compared to MiSeq data, but at the expense of a higher false positive rate. Variant calling from Pacific Biosciences data was possible but higher coverage depth was required. Context specific errors were observed in both PGM and MiSeq data, but not in that from the Pacific Biosciences platform. All three fast turnaround sequencers evaluated here were able to generate usable sequence. However there are key differences between the quality of that data and the applications it will support.},

Results: Comparison with previous reports reveals substantial change in the number of known nuclear protein-coding genes (now 19,116), the protein-coding non-redundant transcriptome space [now 59,281,518 base pair (bp), 10.1{\%} increase], the number of exons (now 562,164, 36.2{\%} increase) due to a relevant increase of the RNA isoforms recorded. Other parameters such as gene, exon or intron mean and extreme length appear to have reached a stability that is unlikely to be substantially modified by human genome data updates, at least regarding protein-coding genes.

abstract = {Frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism, chromosome 17 type (FTDP-17) is caused by mutations in the tau gene, and the signature lesions of FTDP-17 are filamentous tau inclusions. Tau mutations may be pathogenic either by altering protein function or gene regulation. Here we show that missense, silent, and intronic tau mutations can increase or decrease splicing of tau exon 10 (E10) by acting on 3 different cis-acting regulatory elements. These elements include an exon splicing enhancer that can either be strengthened (mutation (N)279(K)) or destroyed (mutation $\Delta$280(K)), resulting in either constitutive E10 inclusion or the exclusion of E10 from tau transcripts. E10 contains a second regulatory element that is an exon splicing silencer, the function of which is abolished by a silent FTDP-17 mutation ((L)284(L)), resulting in excess E10 inclusion. A third element inhibiting E10 splicing is contained in the intronic sequences directly flanking the 5' splice site of E10 and intronic FTDP-17 mutations in this element enhance E10 inclusion. Thus, tau mutations cause FTDP-17 by multiple pathological mechanisms, which may explain the phenotypic heterogeneity observed in FTDP-17, as exemplified by an unusual family described here with tau pathology as well as amyloid and neuritic plaques.},

In order to investigate the molecular details of the inhibitory effect of methylation, we microinjected into Xenopus oocytes a series of constructs containing a human CpG-rich sequence which has been differentially methylated and cloned at different positions relative to a specific promoter. The parameters influencing the diffusion of gene silencing and the importance of histone deacetylation in the spreading effect were analyzed. We demonstrate that a few methylated cytosines can inhibit a flanking promoter but a threshold of modified sites is required to organize a stable, diffusible chromatin structure. Histone deacetylation is the main cause of gene repression only when methylation does not reach levels sufficient to establish this particular structure. Moreover, contrary to the common thought, promoter modification does not lead to the greater repressive effect; the existence of a competition between transactivators and methyl-binding proteins for the establishment of an open conformation justifies the results obtained.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Homozygous loss-of-function mutations in TREM2, encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 protein, have previously been associated with an autosomal recessive form of early-onset dementia. METHODS We used genome, exome, and Sanger sequencing to analyze the genetic variability in TREM2 in a series of 1092 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 1107 controls (the discovery set). We then performed a meta-analysis on imputed data for the TREM2 variant rs75932628 (predicted to cause a R47H substitution) from three genomewide association studies of Alzheimer's disease and tested for the association of the variant with disease. We genotyped the R47H variant in an additional 1887 cases and 4061 controls. We then assayed the expression of TREM2 across different regions of the human brain and identified genes that are differentially expressed in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and in control mice. RESULTS We found significantly more variants in exon 2 of TREM2 in patients with Alzheimer's disease than in controls in the discovery set (P=0.02). There were 22 variant alleles in 1092 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 5 variant alleles in 1107 controls (P{\textless}0.001). The most commonly associated variant, rs75932628 (encoding R47H), showed highly significant association with Alzheimer's disease (P{\textless}0.001). Meta-analysis of rs75932628 genotypes imputed from genomewide association studies confirmed this association (P=0.002), as did direct genotyping of an additional series of 1887 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 4061 controls (P{\textless}0.001). Trem2 expression differed between control mice and a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. CONCLUSIONS Heterozygous rare variants in TREM2 are associated with a significant increase in the risk of Alzheimer's disease. (Funded by Alzheimer's Research UK and others.).},

abstract = {Background: Our understanding of the pig transcriptome is limited. RNA transcript diversity among nine tissues was assessed using poly(A) selected single-molecule long-read isoform sequencing (Iso-seq) and Illumina RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from a single White cross-bred pig. Results: Across tissues, a total of 67,746 unique transcripts were observed, including 60.5{\%} predicted protein-coding, 36.2{\%} long non-coding RNA and 3.3{\%} nonsense-mediated decay transcripts. On average, 90{\%} of the splice junctions were supported by RNA-seq within tissue. A large proportion (80{\%}) represented novel transcripts, mostly produced by known protein-coding genes (70{\%}), while 17{\%} corresponded to novel genes. On average, four transcripts per known gene (tpg) were identified; an increase over current EBI (1.9 tpg) and NCBI (2.9 tpg) annotations and closer to the number reported in human genome (4.2 tpg). Our new pig genome annotation extended more than 6000 known gene borders (5′ end extension, 3′ end extension, or both) compared to EBI or NCBI annotations. We validated a large proportion of these extensions by independent pig poly(A) selected 3′-RNA-seq data, or human FANTOM5 Cap Analysis of Gene Expression data. Further, we detected 10,465 novel genes (81{\%} non-coding) not reported in current pig genome annotations. More than 80{\%} of these novel genes had transcripts detected in {\textgreater} 1 tissue. In addition, more than 80{\%} of novel intergenic genes with at least one transcript detected in liver tissue had H3K4me3 or H3K36me3 peaks mapping to their promoter and gene body, respectively, in independent liver chromatin immunoprecipitation data.},

abstract = {Background: Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) affects the outcome of alternative splicing by degrading mRNA isoforms with premature termination codons. Splicing regulators constitute important NMD targets; however, the extent to which loss of NMD causes extensive deregulation of alternative splicing has not previously been assayed in a global, unbiased manner. Here, we combine mouse genetics and RNA-seq to provide the first in vivo analysis of the global impact of NMD on splicing patterns in two primary mouse tissues ablated for the NMD factor UPF2.Results: We developed a bioinformatic pipeline that maps RNA-seq data to a combinatorial exon database, predicts NMD-susceptibility for mRNA isoforms and calculates the distribution of major splice isoform classes. We present a catalog of NMD-regulated alternative splicing events, showing that isoforms of 30{\%} of all expressed genes are upregulated in NMD-deficient cells and that NMD targets all major splicing classes. Importantly, NMD-dependent effects are not restricted to premature termination codon+ isoforms but also involve an abundance of splicing events that do not generate premature termination codons. Supporting their functional importance, the latter events are associated with high intronic conservation.Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that NMD regulates alternative splicing outcomes through an intricate web of splicing regulators and that its loss leads to the deregulation of a panoply of splicing events, providing novel insights into its role in core- and tissue-specific regulation of gene expression. Thus, our study extends the importance of NMD from an mRNA quality pathway to a regulator of several layers of gene expression. {\textcopyright} 2012 Weischenfeldt et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

@article{Li2020,
abstract = {Background: Depression is a common mental disease that mainly manifests as bad mood, decreased interest, pessimism, slow thinking, lack of initiative, poor diet and sleep. Patients with severe depression have suicidal tendencies. Exosomes are small vesicles released by the fusion of a multivesicular body and membranes, and they contain specific proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids related to the cells from which they originate. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 20-24 nt RNAs that can be packaged into exosomes and can play important regulatory roles. Astrocytes are the most abundant cell population in the central nervous system and have a close link to depression. Astrocyte activation could result in the release of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1$\beta$, IL-6, and TNF-$\alpha$, which could promote the symptoms of depression. In previous research, our team confirmed that NK cells regulate depression in mice. Here, we propose that miRNA in the exosomes from NK cells performs this antidepressant function. Methods: Exosomes from NK cells were shown by in vivo and in vitro experiments to alleviate symptoms of chronic mild stress in mice and decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines release from astrocytes. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines was assessed by ELISA. Microarray analysis was used to identify critical miRNAs. Luciferase reporter assays, qPCR, and other experiments were used to prove that exosomal miR-207 has an important role in alleviating the symptoms of stress in mice. Results: MiRNA-containing exosomes from NK cells could alleviate symptoms of chronic mild stress in mice. In vivo experiments showed that these exosomes decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1$\beta$, IL-6, and TNF-$\alpha$) released by astrocytes. By microarray analysis of exosome miRNA profiles, miR-207 was found to be overexpressed in exosomes derived from unstressed mice. Experiments confirmed that miR-207 directly targets TLR4 interactor with leucine-rich repeats (Tril) and inhibits NF-$\kappa$B signaling in astrocytes. MiR-207 could decrease the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibit expression of Tril in vitro. In vivo experiments revealed that exosomes with low miR-207 levels showed decreased antidepressant activity. Conclusion: Collectively, our findings revealed that exosomal miR-207 alleviated symptoms of depression in stressed mice by targeting Tril to inhibit NF-$\kappa$B signaling in astrocytes.},

We observed the occurrence of an immune response with glial activation, but no changes in genes involved in synaptic transmission or plasticity. Comparison of the mouse gene expression data set with a human data set representing the course of Alzheimer's disease revealed a strikingly limited overlap between gene expression in the APPswe/PS1dE9 and human Alzheimer's disease prefrontal cortex. Only plexin domain containing 2, complement component 4b, and solute carrier family 14 (urea transporter) member 1 were significantly upregulated in the mouse and human brain which might suggest a function in A$\beta$ pathology for these 3 genes. In both data sets we detected clusters of upregulated genes involved in immune-related processes. We conclude that the APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse can be a good model to study the immune response associated with cortical A$\beta$ plaques. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Motivation High-throughput sequencing has transformed the study of gene expression levels through RNA-seq, a technique that is now routinely used by various fields, such as genetic research or diagnostics. The advent of third generation sequencing technologies providing significantly longer reads opens up new possibilities. However, the high error rates common to these technologies set new bioinformatics challenges for the gapped alignment of reads to their genomic origin. In this study, we have explored how currently available RNA-seq splice-aware alignment tools cope with increased read lengths and error rates. All tested tools were initially developed for short NGS reads, but some have claimed support for long Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) or even Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION reads. Results The tools were tested on synthetic and real datasets from two technologies (PacBio and ONT MinION). Alignment quality and resource usage were compared across different aligners. The effect of error correction of long reads was explored, both using self-correction and correction with an external short reads dataset. A tool was developed for evaluating RNA-seq alignment results. This tool can be used to compare the alignment of simulated reads to their genomic origin, or to compare the alignment of real reads to a set of annotated transcripts. Our tests show that while some RNA-seq aligners were unable to cope with long error-prone reads, others produced overall good results. We further show that alignment accuracy can be improved using error-corrected reads.},

abstract = {Annotation of herpesvirus genomes has traditionally been undertaken through the detection of open reading frames and other genomic motifs, supplemented with sequencing of individual cDNAs. Second generation sequencing and high-density microarray studies have revealed vastly greater herpesvirus transcriptome complexity than is captured by existing annotation. The pervasive nature of overlapping transcription throughout herpesvirus genomes, however, poses substantial problems in resolving transcript structures using these methods alone. We present an approach that combines the unique attributes of Pacific Biosciences Iso-Seq long-read, Illumina short-read and deepCAGE (Cap Analysis of Gene Expression) sequencing to globally resolve polyadenylated isoform structures in replicating Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Our method, Transcriptome Resolution through Integration of Multi-platform Data (TRIMD), identifies nearly 300 novel EBV transcripts, quadrupling the size of the annotated viral transcriptome. These findings illustrate an array of mechanisms through which EBV achieves functional diversity in its relatively small, compact genome including programmed alternative splicing (e.g. across the IR1 repeats), alternative promoter usage by LMP2 and other latency-associated transcripts, intergenic splicing at the BZLF2 locus, and antisense transcription and pervasive readthrough transcription throughout the genome.},

Nanopore sequencers output FAST5 files containing signal data subsequently base called to FASTQ format. Optionally, ONT devices can collect data from all sequencing channels simultaneously in a bulk FAST5 file enabling inspection of signal in any channel at any point. We sought to visualize this signal to inspect challenging or difficult to sequence samples. Results: The BulkVis tool can load a bulk FAST5 file and overlays MinKNOW (the software that controls ONT sequencers) classifications on the signal trace and can show mappings to a reference. Users can navigate to a channel and time or, given a FASTQ header from a read, jump to its specific position. BulkVis can export regions as Nanopore base caller compatible reads. Using BulkVis, we find long reads can be incorrectly divided by MinKNOW resulting in single DNA molecules being split into two or more reads. The longest seen to date is 2 272 580 bases in length and reported in eleven consecutive reads. We provide helper scripts that identify and reconstruct split reads given a sequencing summary file and alignment to a reference. We note that incorrect read splitting appears to vary according to input sample type and is more common in'ultra-long' read preparations.},

Most patients with Alzheimer's disease ({\textgreater}95{\%}) have the sporadic form, which is characterized by a late onset (80-90 years of age), and is the consequence of the failure to clear the amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) peptide from the interstices of the brain.

A small proportion of patients ({\textless}1{\%}) have inherited mutations in genes that affect processing of A$\beta$ and develop the disease at a much younger age (mean age of ∼45 years). Detection of the accumulation of A$\beta$ is now possible in preclinical and prodromal phases using cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and PET. Several approved drugs ameliorate some of the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, but no current interventions can modify the underlying disease mechanisms.

abstract = {The transactive response (TAR) DNA binding protein TDP-43 has been discovered to be a major ubiquitinated protein in frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitinated tau-negative inclusions (FTLD-U), which consequently has been renamed FTLD-TDP. However, TDP-43 has since been detected in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) but is often confined to the limbic region rather than the more widespread pattern seen in FTLD-TDP. Previous work has suggested some relationship between hippocampal sclerosis and TDP-43 expression. A number of AD cases of both moderate and high stage were examined to determine whether the pattern of TDP-43 immunohistochemical expression differed and whether any relationship to hippocampal sclerosis could be detected. Cases of hippocampal sclerosis from surgical epilepsy specimens were examined to determine whether hippocampal sclerosis alone could cause abnormal TDP-43 expression. To establish whether abnormal TDP-43 expression in other neurodegenerative diseases resembled the pattern and distribution in FTLD-TDP we examined multiple blocks from a variety of neurodegenerative conditions. In 75{\%} of cases of high-stage AD there was abnormal TDP-43 positivity compared to 57{\%} of moderate-stage AD. While the abnormal TDP-43 positivity was confined to the limbic regions in the moderate stages, occasional cases in the high stages showed neocortical positivity. Also amygdala and/or entorhinal positivity appeared to precede positivity in the dentate gyrus. No relationship could be established between abnormal TDP-43 expression and degree of hippocampal sclerosis either in the surgical or autopsy cases. The pattern of distribution of TDP-43 inclusions from cases of dementia pugilistica most closely resembled that in FTLD-TDP. This raises the question as to whether there may be some shared pathogenic mechanisms between the two conditions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Japanese Society of Neuropathology.},

However, although many thousands of alternatively spliced transcripts are routinely detected in RNA-seq studies, reliable large-scale mass spectrometry-based proteomics analyses identify only a small fraction of annotated alternative isoforms. The clearest finding from proteomics experiments is that most human genes have a single main protein isoform, while those alternative isoforms that are identified tend to be the most biologically plausible: those with the most cross-species conservation and those that do not compromise functional domains. Indeed, most alternative exons do not seem to be under selective pressure, suggesting that a large majority of predicted alternative transcripts may not even be translated into proteins.},

abstract = {The human genome is arguably the most complete mammalian reference assembly, yet more than 160 euchromatic gaps remain and aspects of its structural variation remain poorly understood ten years after its completion. To identify missing sequence and genetic variation, here we sequence and analyse a haploid human genome (CHM1) using single-molecule, real-time DNA sequencing. We close or extend 55{\%} of the remaining interstitial gaps in the human GRCh37 reference genome--78{\%} of which carried long runs of degenerate short tandem repeats, often several kilobases in length, embedded within (G+C)-rich genomic regions. We resolve the complete sequence of 26,079 euchromatic structural variants at the base-pair level, including inversions, complex insertions and long tracts of tandem repeats. Most have not been previously reported, with the greatest increases in sensitivity occurring for events less than 5 kilobases in size. Compared to the human reference, we find a significant insertional bias (3:1) in regions corresponding to complex insertions and long short tandem repeats. Our results suggest a greater complexity of the human genome in the form of variation of longer and more complex repetitive DNA that can now be largely resolved with the application of this longer-read sequencing technology.},

abstract = {Through alternative processing of pre-messenger RNAs, individual mammalian genes often produce multiple mRNA and protein isoforms that may have related, distinct or even opposing functions. Here we report an in-depth analysis of 15 diverse human tissue and cell line transcriptomes on the basis of deep sequencing of complementary DNA fragments, yielding a digital inventory of gene and mRNA isoform expression. Analyses in which sequence reads are mapped to exon-exon junctions indicated that 92-94{\%} of human genes undergo alternative splicing, 86{\%} with a minor isoform frequency of 15{\%} or more. Differences in isoform-specific read densities indicated that most alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation events vary between tissues, whereas variation between individuals was approximately twofold to threefold less common. Extreme or 'switch-like' regulation of splicing between tissues was associated with increased sequence conservation in regulatory regions and with generation of full-length open reading frames. Patterns of alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation were strongly correlated across tissues, suggesting coordinated regulation of these processes, and sequence conservation of a subset of known regulatory motifs in both alternative introns and 3' untranslated regions suggested common involvement of specific factors in tissue-level regulation of both splicing and polyadenylation.},

abstract = {We use deep sequencing to identify sources of variation in mRNA splicing in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC) of 450 subjects from two prospective cohort studies of aging. Hundreds of aberrant pre-mRNA splicing events are reproducibly associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We also generate a catalog of splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTL) effects in the human cortex: splicing of 3,198 genes is influenced by genetic variation. sQTLs are enriched among those variants influencing DNA methylation and histone acetylation. In assessing known AD loci, we report that altered splicing is the mechanism for the effects of the PICALM, CLU, and PTK2B susceptibility alleles. Further, we leverage our sQTL catalog to identify genes whose aberrant splicing is associated with AD and mediated by genetics. This transcriptome-wide association study identified 21 genes with significant associations, many of which are found in AD GWAS loci, but 8 are in novel AD loci, including FUS, which is a known amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) gene. This highlights an intriguing shared genetic architecture that is further elaborated by the convergence of old and new AD genes in autophagy-lysosomal-related pathways already implicated in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Overall, this study of the aging brain's transcriptome provides evidence that dysregulation of mRNA splicing is a feature of AD and is, in some genetically-driven cases, causal.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BPD) are severe mental disorders with high heritability. Clinicians have long noticed the similarities of clinic symptoms between these disorders. In recent years, accumulating evidence indicates some shared genetic liabilities. However, what is shared remains elusive. In this study, we conducted whole transcriptome analysis of post-mortem brain tissues (cingulate cortex) from SCZ, BPD and control subjects, and identified differentially expressed genes in these disorders. We found 105 and 153 genes differentially expressed in SCZ and BPD, respectively. By comparing the t-test scores, we found that many of the genes differentially expressed in SCZ and BPD are concordant in their expression level (q0.01, 53 genes; q0.05, 213 genes; q0.1, 885 genes). Using genome-wide association data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, we found that these differentially and concordantly expressed genes were enriched in association signals for both SCZ (P{\textless}10−7) and BPD (P=0.029). To our knowledge, this is the first time that a substantially large number of genes show concordant expression and association for both SCZ and BPD. Pathway analyses of these genes indicated that they are involved in the lysosome, Fc gamma receptor-mediated phagocytosis, regulation of actin cytoskeleton pathways, along with several cancer pathways. Functional analyses of these genes revealed an interconnected pathway network centered on lysosomal function and the regulation of actin cytoskeleton. These pathways and their interacting network were principally confirmed by an independent transcriptome sequencing data set of the hippocampus. Dysregulation of lysosomal function and cytoskeleton remodeling has direct impacts on endocytosis, phagocytosis, exocytosis, vesicle trafficking, neuronal maturation and migration, neurite outgrowth and synaptic density and plasticity, and different aspects of these processes have been implicated in SCZ and BPD.},

abstract = {We have collected over half a million splice sites from five species - Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans and Arabidopsis thaliana - and classified them into four subtypes: U2-type GT-AG and GC-AG and U12-type GT-AG and AT-AC. We have also found new examples of rare splice-site categories, such as U12-type introns without canonical borders, and U2-dependent AT-AC introns. The splice-site sequences and several tools to explore them are available on a public website (SpliceRack). For the U12-type introns, we find several features conserved across species, as well as a clustering of these introns on genes. Using the information content of the splice-site motifs, and the phylogenetic distance between them, we identify: (i) a higher degree of conservation in the exonic portion of the U2-type splice sites in more complex organisms; (ii) conservation of exonic nucleotides for U12-type splice sites; (iii) divergent evolution of C.elegans 3′ splice sites (3′ss) and (iv) distinct evolutionary histories of 5′ and 3′ss. Our study proves that the identification of broad patterns in naturally-occurring splice sites, through the analysis of genomic datasets, provides mechanistic and evolutionary insights into pre-mRNA splicing. {\textcopyright} 2006 Oxford University Press.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s).Background: High throughput gene expression profiling assays of peripheral blood are widely used in biomedicine, as well as in animal genetics and physiology research. Accurate, comprehensive, and precise interpretation of such high throughput assays relies on well-characterized reference genomes and/or transcriptomes. However, neither the reference genome nor the peripheral blood transcriptome of the pig have been sufficiently assembled and annotated to support such profiling assays in this emerging biomedical model organism. We aimed to assemble published and novel RNA-seq data to provide a comprehensive, well-annotated blood transcriptome for pigs by integrating a de novo assembly with a genome-guided assembly. Results: A de novo and a genome-guided transcriptome of porcine whole peripheral blood was assembled with {\~{}}162 million pairs of paired-end and {\~{}}183 million single-end, trimmed and normalized Illumina RNA-seq reads ({\~{}}6 billion initial reads from 146 RNA-seq libraries) from five independent studies by using the Trinity and Cufflinks software, respectively. We then removed putative transcripts (PTs) of low confidence from both assemblies and merged the remaining PTs into an integrated transcriptome consisting of 132,928 PTs, with 126,225 ({\~{}}95{\%}) PTs from the de novo assembly and more than 91{\%} of PTs spliced. In the integrated transcriptome, {\~{}}90{\%} and 63{\%} of PTs had significant sequence similarity to sequences in the NCBI NT and NR databases, respectively; 68,754 ({\~{}}52{\%}) PTs were annotated with 15,965 unique gene ontology (GO) terms; and 7618 PTs annotated with Enzyme Commission codes were assigned to 134 pathways curated by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Full exon-intron junctions of 17,528 PTs were validated by PacBio IsoSeq full-length cDNA reads from 3 other porcine tissues, NCBI pig RefSeq mRNAs and transcripts from Ensembl Sscrofa10.2 annotation. Completeness of the 5' termini of 37,569 PTs was validated by public cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) data. By comparison to the Ensembl transcripts, we found that (1) the deduced precursors of 54,402 PTs shared at least one intron or exon with those of 18,437 Ensembl transcripts; (2) 12,262 PTs had both longer 5' and 3' termini than their maximally overlapping Ensembl transcripts; and (3) 41,838 spliced PTs were totally missing from the Sscrofa10.2 annotation. Similar results were obtained when the PTs were compared to the pig NCBI RefSeq mRNA collection. Conclusions: We built, validated and annotated a comprehensive porcine blood transcriptome with significant improvement over the annotation of Ensembl Sscrofa10.2 and the pig NCBI RefSeq mRNAs, and laid a foundation for blood-based high throughput transcriptomic assays in pigs and for advancing annotation of the pig genome.},

Loss of Spata13, also known as the adenomatous polyposis coli exchange factor Asef2, has no identifiable phenotype although it has been shown to reduce the number and size of intestinal tumours in Apc (Min/+) mice. Nevertheless, its brain-related functions have not been investigated. To pursue this, we have generated a Spata13 knockout mouse line using CRISPR-mediated deletion of an exon containing the GTPase domain that is common to multiple isoforms. Homozygous mutants were viable and appeared normal. We subjected both male and female cohorts to a comprehensive battery of behavioural tests designed to investigate particular CeA-related functions. Here, we show that Spata13 modulates social behaviour with homozygous mutants being subordinate to wildtype controls. Furthermore, female homozygotes show increased activity in home cages during the dark phase of the light–dark cycle. In summary, Spata13 modulates social hierarchy in both male and female mice in addition to affecting voluntary activity in females.},

abstract = {Evidence accumulated over the past decade shows that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are widely expressed and have key roles in gene regulation. Recent studies have begun to unravel how the biogenesis of lncRNAs is distinct from that of mRNAs and is linked with their specific subcellular localizations and functions. Depending on their localization and their specific interactions with DNA, RNA and proteins, lncRNAs can modulate chromatin function, regulate the assembly and function of membraneless nuclear bodies, alter the stability and translation of cytoplasmic mRNAs and interfere with signalling pathways. Many of these functions ultimately affect gene expression in diverse biological and physiopathological contexts, such as in neuronal disorders, immune responses and cancer. Tissue-specific and condition-specific expression patterns suggest that lncRNAs are potential biomarkers and provide a rationale to target them clinically. In this Review, we discuss the mechanisms of lncRNA biogenesis, localization and functions in transcriptional, post-transcriptional and other modes of gene regulation, and their potential therapeutic applications.},

Here, we investigated the prevalence and disease penetrance of ABCA7 PTC mutations in a large early onset AD (EOAD)—control cohort, and examined the effect on transcript level with comprehensive third-generation long-read sequencing. We characterized the ABCA7 coding sequence with next-generation sequencing in 928 EOAD patients and 980 matched control individuals. With MetaSKAT rare variant association analysis, we observed a fivefold enrichment (p = 0.0004) of PTC mutations in EOAD patients (3{\%}) versus controls (0.6{\%}). Ten novel PTC mutations were only observed in patients, and PTC mutation carriers in general had an increased familial AD load. In addition, we observed nominal risk reducing trends for three common coding variants. Seven PTC mutations were further analyzed using targeted long-read cDNA sequencing on an Oxford Nanopore MinION platform. PTC-containing transcripts for each investigated PTC mutation were observed at varying proportion (5–41{\%} of the total read count), implying incomplete nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Furthermore, we distinguished and phased several previously unknown alternative splicing events (up to 30{\%} of transcripts). In conjunction with PTC mutations, several of these novel ABCA7 isoforms have the potential to rescue deleterious PTC effects. In conclusion, ABCA7 PTC mutations play a substantial role in EOAD, warranting genetic screening of ABCA7 in genetically unexplained patients. Long-read cDNA sequencing revealed both varying degrees of NMD and transcript-modifying events, which may influence ABCA7 dosage, disease severity, and may create opportunities for therapeutic interventions in AD.

abstract = {Background: Determining the secondary structure of RNA from the primary structure is a challenging computational problem. A number of algorithms have been developed to predict the secondary structure from the primary structure. It is agreed that there is still room for improvement in each of these approaches. In this work we build a predictive model for secondary RNA structure using a graph-theoretic tree representation of secondary RNA structure. We model the bonding of two RNA secondary structures to form a larger secondary structure with a graph operation we call merge. We consider all combinatorial possibilities using all possible tree inputs, both those that are RNA-like in structure and those that are not. The resulting data from each tree merge operation is represented by a vector. We use these vectors as input values for a neural network and train the network to recognize a tree as RNA-like or not, based on the merge data vector. The network estimates the probability of a tree being RNA-like.Results: The network correctly assigned a high probability of RNA-likeness to trees previously identified as RNA-like and a low probability of RNA-likeness to those classified as not RNA-like. We then used the neural network to predict the RNA-likeness of the unclassified trees.Conclusions: There are a number of secondary RNA structure prediction algorithms available online. These programs are based on finding the secondary structure with the lowest total free energy. In this work, we create a predictive tool for secondary RNA structures using graph-theoretic values as input for a neural network. The use of a graph operation to theoretically describe the bonding of secondary RNA is novel and is an entirely different approach to the prediction of secondary RNA structures. Our method correctly predicted trees to be RNA-like or not RNA-like for all known cases. In addition, our results convey a measure of likelihood that a tree is RNA-like or not RNA-like. Given that the majority of secondary RNA folding algorithms return more than one possible outcome, our method provides a means of determining the best or most likely structures among all of the possible outcomes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Knisley et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a genetically complex and heterogeneous disorder. To date four genes have been established to either cause early-onset autosomal-dominant AD (APP, PSEN1, and PSEN21-4) or to increase susceptibility for late-onset AD (APOE5). However, the heritability of late-onset AD is as high as 80{\%},6 and much of the phenotypic variance remains unexplained to date. We performed a genome-wide association (GWA) analysis using 484,522 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on a large (1,376 samples from 410 families) sample of AD families of self-reported European descent. We identified five SNPs showing either significant or marginally significant genome-wide association with a multivariate phenotype combining affection status and onset age. One of these signals (p = 5.7 × 10-14) was elicited by SNP rs4420638 and probably reflects APOE-$\epsilon$4, which maps 11 kb proximal (r2 = 0.78). The other four signals were tested in three additional independent AD family samples composed of nearly 2700 individuals from almost 900 families. Two of these SNPs showed significant association in the replication samples (combined p values 0.007 and 0.00002). The SNP (rs11159647, on chromosome 14q31) with the strongest association signal also showed evidence of association with the same allele in GWA data generated in an independent sample of ∼1,400 AD cases and controls (p = 0.04). Although the precise identity of the underlying locus(i) remains elusive, our study provides compelling evidence for the existence of at least one previously undescribed AD gene that, like APOE-$\epsilon$4, primarily acts as a modifier of onset age. {\textcopyright} 2008 The American Society of Human Genetics.},

abstract = {Mutations leading to premature termination codons in ATP-Binding Cassette Subfamily A Member 7 (ABCA7) are high penetrant risk factors of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The influence of other genetic variants in ABCA7 and downstream functional mechanisms, however, is poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated tandem repetitive regions in ABCA7 in a Belgian cohort of 1529 AD patients and control individuals and identified an intronic variable number tandem repeat (VNTR). We observed strong association between VNTR length and a genome-wide associated signal for AD in the ABCA7 locus. Expanded VNTR alleles were highly enriched in AD patients [odds ratio = 4.5 (1.3–24.2)], and VNTR length inversely correlated with amyloid $\beta$ 1–42 in cerebrospinal fluid and ABCA7 expression. In addition, we identified three novel ABCA7 alternative splicing events. One isoform in particular—which is formed through exon 19 skipping—lacks the first nucleotide binding domain of ABCA7 and is abundant in brain tissue. We observed a tight correlation between exon 19 skipping and VNTR length. Our findings underline the importance of studying repetitive DNA in complex disorders and expand the contribution of genetic and transcript variation in ABCA7 to AD.},

A large number of genome-wide association studies have been performed, which have been supplemented more recently by the first epigenome-wide association studies, leading to the identification of a number of novel loci altered in disease. Twin studies have shown monozygotic twin discordance for Alzheimer's disease (Gatz et al., 2006), leading to the conclusion that a combination of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms is likely to be involved in disease etiology (Lunnon {\&} Mill, 2013). This review focuses on identifying overlapping pathways between published genome-wide association studies and epigenome-wide association studies, highlighting dysfunctional synaptic, lipid metabolism, plasma membrane/cytoskeleton, mitochondrial, and immune cell activation pathways. Identifying common pathways altered in genetic and epigenetic studies will aid our understanding of disease mechanisms and identify potential novel targets for pharmacological intervention.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies are a powerful approach for identifying genes related to complex traits in organisms, but are limited by the requirement for a reference genome sequence of the species under study. To circumvent this problem, we propose a transcriptome-referenced association study (TRAS) that utilizes a transcriptome generated by single-molecule long-read sequencing as a reference sequence to score population variation at both transcript sequence and expression levels. Candidate transcripts are identified when both scores are associated with a trait and their potential interactions are ascertained by expression quantitative trait loci analysis. Applying this method to characterize garlic clove shape traits in 102 landraces, we identified 22 candidate transcripts, most of which showed extensive interactions. Eight transcripts were long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and the others were proteins involved mainly in carbohydrate metabolism, protein degradation, etc. TRAS, as an efficient tool for association study independent of a reference genome, extends the applicability of association studies to a broad range of species.},

The universal presence of $\beta$-amyloid and tau in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has facilitated advancement of the amyloid cascade and tau hypotheses that have dominated AD pathogenesis research and therapeutic development. However, the underlying etiology of the disease remains to be fully elucidated. Here we report a comprehensive study of the human brain-insoluble proteome in AD by mass spectrometry. We identify 4,216 proteins, among which 36 proteins accumulate in the disease, including U1-70K and other U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) spliceosome components. Similar accumulations in mild cognitive impairment cases indicate that spliceosome changes occur in early stages of AD. Multiple U1 snRNP subunits form cytoplasmic tangle-like structures in AD but not in other examined neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Comparison of RNA from AD and control brains reveals dysregulated RNA processing with accumulation of unspliced RNA species in AD, including myc box-dependent-interacting protein 1, clusterin, and presenilin-1. U1-70K knockdown or antisense oligonucleotide inhibition of U1 snRNP increases the protein level of amyloid precursor protein. Thus, our results demonstrate unique U1 snRNP pathology and implicate abnormal RNA splicing in AD pathogenesis.},

ZNF804A transcripts were investigated using next-generation sequencing and polymerase chain reaction-based methods, and ZNF804A protein was investigated using Western blots and immunohistochemistry. Samples of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and inferior parietal lobe tissue were interrogated from 697 participants between 14 weeks' gestational age and age 85 years, including patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMain Outcomes and Measures: Quantitative measurements of ZNF804A mRNA and immunoreactivity, and the effect of diagnosis and rs1344706 genotype.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nResults: ZNF804A was expressed across the life span, with highest expression prenatally.

abstract = {Pre-mRNA splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a multimegadalton ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex comprised of five snRNPs and numerous proteins. Intricate RNA-RNA and RNP networks, which serve to align the reactive groups of the pre-mRNA for catalysis, are formed and repeatedly rearranged during spliceosome assembly and catalysis. Both the conformation and composition of the spliceosome are highly dynamic, affording the splicing machinery its accuracy and flexibility, and these remarkable dynamics are largely conserved between yeast and metazoans. Because of its dynamic and complex nature, obtaining structural information about the spliceosome represents a major challenge. Electron microscopy has revealed the general morphology of several spliceosomal complexes and their snRNP subunits, and also the spatial arrangement of some of their components. X-ray and NMR studies have provided high resolution structure information about spliceosomal proteins alone or complexed with one or more binding partners. The extensive interplay of RNA and proteins in aligning the pre-mRNA's reactive groups, and the presence of both RNA and protein at the core of the splicing machinery, suggest that the spliceosome is an RNPenzyme. However, elucidation of the precise nature of the spliceosome's active site, awaits the generation of a high-resolution structure of its RNP core. {\textcopyright} 2011 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

We surveyed gene-expression changes associated with AD pathology and TREM2 in 5XFAD mice and in human AD by single-nucleus RNA sequencing. We confirmed the presence of Trem2-dependent DAM and identified a previously undiscovered Serpina3n+C4b+ reactive oligodendrocyte population in mice. Interestingly, remarkably different glial phenotypes were evident in human AD. Microglia signature was reminiscent of IRF8-driven reactive microglia in peripheral-nerve injury. Oligodendrocyte signatures suggested impaired axonal myelination and metabolic adaptation to neuronal degeneration. Astrocyte profiles indicated weakened metabolic coordination with neurons. Notably, the reactive phenotype of microglia was less evident in TREM2-R47H and TREM2-R62H carriers than in non-carriers, demonstrating a TREM2 requirement in both mouse and human AD, despite the marked species-specific differences.},

Synthetic $\beta$-amyloid protein (1-40) was rapidly degraded by a human brain soluble fraction, optimum activity occurring at around pH4. Pepstatin totally inhibited the activity showing that an aspartyl protease was responsible. HPLC separation and identification of the degradation products showed that the L34-M35 bond was the primary site of cleavage followed by hydrolysis of the F19-F20 and F20-A21 bonds. The major lysosomal aspartyl protease, cathepsin D, hydrolysed $\beta$-amyloid protein with the same pH profile, inhibitor sensitivity and bond specificity as the activity present in human brain soluble fraction. We suggest that cathepsin D may play an important role in regulating brain concentrations of $\beta$-amyloid protein (1-40).},

Out of 7,156 genes with reliable quantification of both alleles, we found 1,008 (14.1{\%}) exhibiting significant allelic divergence in translational efficiency. Systematic analysis of sequence features of the genes with biased allelic translation revealed that local RNA secondary structure surrounding the start codon and proximal out-of-frame upstream AUGs could affect translational efficiency. Finally, we observed that the cis-effect was quantitatively comparable between tran-scriptional and translational regulation. Such effects in the two regulatory processes were more frequently compensatory, suggest-ing that the regulation at the two levels could be coordinated in maintaining robustness of protein expression.},

abstract = {Progressive memory loss and cognitive dysfunction are the hallmark clinical features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Identifying the molecular triggers for the onset of AD-related cognitive decline presently requires the use of suitable animal models, such as the 3xTg-AD mice, which develop both amyloid and tangle pathology. Here, we characterize the onset of learning and memory deficits in this model. We report that 2-month-old, prepathologic mice are cognitively unimpaired. The earliest cognitive impairment manifests at 4 months as a deficit in long-term retention and correlates with the accumulation of intraneuronal A$\beta$ in the hippocampus and amygdala. Plaque or tangle pathology is not apparent at this age, suggesting that they contribute to cognitive dysfunction at later time points. Clearance of the intraneuronal A$\beta$ pathology by immunotherapy rescues the early cognitive deficits on a hippocampal-dependent task. Reemergence of the A$\beta$ pathology again leads to cognitive deficits. This study strongly implicates intraneuronal A$\beta$ in the onset of cognitive dysfunction.

abstract = {Here, we describe the generation of a novel transgenic mouse model of human tauopathy. The rTg(tauP301L)4510 mouse expresses the P301L mutation in tau (4R0N) associated with frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17. Transgene expression was driven by a forebrain-specific Ca 2+ calmodulin kinase II promoter system resulting in high levels of expression in the hippocampus and neocortex. Importantly, transgene expression in this model is induced via the tetracycline-operon responsive element and is suppressed after treatment with doxycycline. Continued transgene expression in rTg(tauP301L)4510 mice results in age-dependent development of many salient characteristics of hereditary human dementia. From an early age, immunohistochemical studies demonstrated abnormal biochemical processing of tau and the presence of pathological conformation- and phosphorylation-dependent epitopes. Neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology was first observed in the neocortex and progressed into the hippocampus and limbic structures with increasing age. Consistent with the formation of NFTs, immunoblots indicated an age-dependent transition of accumulating tau species from Sarkosyl soluble 55 kDa to insoluble hyperphosphorylated 64 kDa. Ultrastructural analysis revealed the presence of straight tau filaments. Furthermore, the effects of tau P301L expression on spatial reference memory were longitudinally tested using the Morris water maze. Compared with nontransgenic age-matched control littermates, rTg(tauP301L)4510 mice developed significant cognitive impairments from 4 months of age. Memory deficits were accompanied by gross forebrain atrophy and a prominent loss of neurons, most strikingly in hippocampal subdivision CA1. Collectively, these data describe a novel transgenic mouse that closely mimics human tauopathy and may represent an important model for the future study of tau-related neurodegenerative disease.

abstract = {The human brain is one of the last frontiers of biomedical research. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have succeeded in identifying thousands of haplotype blocks associated with a range of neuropsychiatric traits, including disorders such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. However, the majority of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that mark these haplotype blocks fall within non-coding regions of the genome, hindering their functional validation. While some of these GWAS loci may contain cis-acting regulatory DNA elements such as enhancers, we hypothesized that many are also transcribed into non-coding RNAs that are missing from publicly available transcriptome annotations. Here, we use targeted RNA capture ('RNA CaptureSeq') in combination with nanopore long-read cDNA sequencing to transcriptionally profile 1,023 haplotype blocks across the genome containing non-coding GWAS SNPs associated with neuropsychiatric traits, using post-mortem human brain tissue from three neurologically healthy donors. We find that the majority (62{\%}) of targeted haplotype blocks, including 13{\%} of intergenic blocks, are transcribed into novel, multi-exonic RNAs, most of which are not yet recorded in GENCODE annotations. We validated our findings with short-read RNA-seq, providing orthogonal confirmation of novel splice junctions and enabling a quantitative assessment of the long-read assemblies. Many novel transcripts are supported by independent evidence of transcription including cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) data and epigenetic marks, and some show signs of potential functional roles. We present these transcriptomes as a preliminary atlas of non-coding transcription in human brain that can be used to connect neurological phenotypes with gene expression.},

abstract = {Motivation: Alternative splicing is central for cellular processes and substantially increases transcriptome and proteome diversity. Aberrant splicing events often have pathological consequences and are associated with various diseases and cancer types. The emergence of next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provides an exciting new technology to analyse alternative splicing on a large scale. However, algorithms that enable the analysis of alternative splicing from short-read sequencing are not fully established yet and there are still no standard solutions available for a variety of data analysis tasks.$\backslash$nResults: We present a new method and software to predict genes that are differentially spliced between two different conditions using RNA-seq data. Our method uses geometric angles between the high dimensional vectors of exon read counts. With this, differential splicing can be detected even if the splicing events are composed of higher complexity and involve previously unknown splicing patterns. We applied our approach to two case studies including neuroblastoma tumour data with favourable and unfavourable clinical courses. We show the validity of our predictions as well as the applicability of our method in the context of patient clustering. We verified our predictions by several methods including simulated experiments and complementary in silico analyses. We found a significant number of exons with specific regulatory splicing factor motifs for predicted genes and a substantial number of publications linking those genes to alternative splicing. Furthermore, we could successfully exploit splicing information to cluster tissues and patients. Finally, we found additional evidence of splicing diversity for many predicted genes in normalized read coverage plots and in reads that span exon–exon junctions.$\backslash$nAvailability: SplicingCompass is licensed under the GNU GPL and freely available as a package in the statistical language R at http://www.ichip.de/software/SplicingCompass.html$\backslash$nContact: m.aschoff@dkfz.de or r.koenig@dkfz.de$\backslash$nSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {The three isoforms of apolipoprotein (apo) E are strongly associated with different risks for Alzheimer's disease: apoE4 {\textgreater} apoE3 {\textgreater} apoE2. Here, we show at physiological salt concentrations and pH that native tetramers of apoE form soluble aggregates in vitro that bind the amyloid dyes thioflavin T and Congo red. However, unlike classic amyloid fibrils, the aggregates adopt an irregular protofilament-like morphology and are seemingly highly $\alpha$-helical. The aggregates formed at substantially different rates (apoE4 {\textgreater} apoE3 {\textgreater} apoE2) and were significantly more toxic to cultured neuronal cells than the tetramer. Since the three isoforms have large differences in conformational stability that can influence aggregation and amyloid pathways, we tested the effects of mutations that increased or decreased stability. Decreasing the conformational stability of the amino-terminal domain of apoE increased aggregation rates and vice versa. Our findings provide a new perspective for an isoform-specific pathogenic role for apoE aggregation in which differences in the conformational stability of the amino-terminal domain mediate neurodegeneration. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

A$\beta$1-42(43) was elevated in plasma from subjects with FAD-linked PSI (P {\textless} 0.0001), PS2(N1411) (P = 0.009), APP(K670N,M671L) (P {\textless} 0.0001), and APP(V7171) (one subject) mutations. A$\beta$ ending at A1$\beta$42(43) was also significantly elevated in fibroblast media from subjects with PS1 (P {\textless} 0.0001) or PS2 (P = 0.03) mutations.

abstract = {APOE and Trem2 are major genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but how they affect microglia response to A$\beta$ remains unclear. Here we report an APOE isoform-specific phospholipid signature with correlation between human APOE$\epsilon$3/3 and APOE$\epsilon$4/4 AD brain and lipoproteins from astrocyte conditioned media of APOE3 and APOE4 mice. Using preclinical AD mouse models, we show that APOE3 lipoproteins, unlike APOE4, induce faster microglial migration towards injected A$\beta$, facilitate A$\beta$ uptake, and ameliorate A$\beta$ effects on cognition. Bulk and single-cell RNA-seq demonstrate that, compared to APOE4, cortical infusion of APOE3 lipoproteins upregulates a higher proportion of genes linked to an activated microglia response, and this trend is augmented by TREM2 deficiency. In vitro, lack of TREM2 decreases A$\beta$ uptake by APOE4-treated microglia only, suggesting TREM2-APOE interaction. Our study elucidates phenotypic and transcriptional differences in microglial response to A$\beta$ mediated by APOE3 or APOE4 lipoproteins in preclinical models of AD.},

The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project has systematically mapped regions of transcription, transcription factor association, chromatin structure and histone modification. These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80{\%} of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Background: The clusterin (CLU) gene has been identified as an important risk locus for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the actual risk-increasing polymorphisms at this locus remain to be identified, we previously observed an increased frequency of rare non-synonymous mutations and small insertion-deletions of CLU in AD patients, which specifically clustered in the $\beta$-chain domain of CLU. Nonetheless the pathogenic nature of these variants remained unclear. Here we report a novel non-synonymous CLU mutation (p.I360N) in a Belgian Alzheimer patient and have explored the pathogenic nature of this and 10 additional CLU mutations on protein localization and secretion in vitro using immunocytochemistry, immunodetection and ELISAs. Results: Three patient-specific CLU mutations in the $\beta$-chain (p.I303NfsX13, p.R338W and p.I360N) caused an alteration of the subcellular CLU localization and diminished CLU transport through the secretory pathway, indicative of possible degradation mechanisms. For these mutations, significantly reduced CLU intensity was observed in the Golgi while almost all CLU protein was exclusively present in the endoplasmic reticulum. This was further confirmed by diminished CLU secretion in HEK293T and HEK293 FLp-In cell lines. Conclusions: Our data lend further support to the contribution of rare coding CLU mutations in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Functional analyses suggest reduced secretion of the CLU protein as the mode of action for three of the examined CLU mutations. One of those is a frameshift mutation leading to a loss of secreted protein, and the other two mutations are amino acid substitutions in the disulfide bridge region, possibly interfering with heterodimerization of the {\'{a}}- and $\beta$-chain of CLU.},

Additionally, we uncover APA of {\&}{\#}x223C;11,000 expressed genes and more than 2,100 novel genes.

abstract = {Aging is the biggest risk factor for idiopathic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, the National Institutes of Health released AD research recommendations that include: appreciating normal brain aging, expanding data-driven research, using open-access resources, and evaluating experimental reproducibility. Transcriptome data sets for aging and AD in humans and animal models are available in NIH-curated, publically accessible databases. However, little work has been done to test for concordance among those molecular signatures. Here, we test the hypothesis that brain transcriptional profiles from animal models recapitulate those observed in the human condition. Raw transcriptional profile data from twenty-nine studies were analyzed to produce p-values and fold changes for young vs. aged or control vs. AD conditions. Concordance across profiles was assessed at three levels: (1) {\#} of significant genes observed vs. {\#} expected by chance; (2) proportion of significant genes showing directional agreement; (3) correlation among studies for magnitude of effect among significant genes. The highest concordance was found within subjects across brain regions. Normal brain aging was concordant across studies, brain regions, and species, despite profound differences in chronological aging among humans, rats and mice. Human studies of idiopathic AD were concordant across brain structures and studies, but were not concordant with the transcriptional profiles of transgenic AD mouse models. Further, the five transgenic AD mouse models that were assessed were not concordant with one another. These results suggest that normal brain aging is similar in humans and research animals, and that different transgenic AD model mice may reflect selected aspects of AD pathology.},

abstract = {A number of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), are characterized by intraneuronal accumulation of the tau protein. Some forms of FTDP-17 are caused by mutations in the tau gene affecting exon 10 splicing. Therefore, dysregulation of tau pre-mRNA splicing may be a contributing factor to sporadic tauopathies. To address this question, we devised a real-time RT-PCR strategy based on the use of a single fluorogenic probe to evaluate the ratio between tau isoforms containing or lacking exon 10 (4R/3R ratio) in post-mortem brain samples. We found a two- to six-fold increase in the 4R/3R ratio in cases of FTDP-17 linked to a splice site mutation, hence confirming the validity of the strategy. The difference in the 4R/3R ratio in the superior temporal and superior frontal gyri between AD and control brains was not statistically significant. Similarly, there was no significant difference in the 4R/3R ratio between Pick's disease cases and controls, indicating that the predominance of tau3R protein in PiD reflects post-translational modifications of specific isoforms. This study indicates that post-translational events are likely to be the main factors controlling tau isoform composition in sporadic tauopathies and highlights the benefit of quantitative RT-PCR in the assessment of splicing abnormalities in tauopathies. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

However, several applications are limited by relatively high single-read error rates ({\textgreater} 10 {\%}), including RNA-seq, haplotype sequencing and 16S sequencing. Results: We developed the Intramolecular-ligated Nanopore Consensus Sequencing (INC-Seq) as a strategy for obtaining long and accurate nanopore reads, starting with low input DNA. Applying INC-Seq for 16S rRNA-based bacterial profiling generated full-length amplicon sequences with a median accuracy {\textgreater} 97 {\%}. Conclusions: INC-Seq reads enabled accurate species-level classification, identification of species at 0.1 {\%} abundance and robust quantification of relative abundances, providing a cheap and effective approach for pathogen detection and microbiome profiling on the MinION system.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing (AS) can critically affect gene function and disease, yet mapping splicing variations remains a challenge. Here, we propose a new approach to define and quantify mRNA splicing in units of local splicing variations (LSVs). LSVs capture previously defined types of alternative splicing as well as more complex transcript variations. Building the first genome wide map of LSVs from twelve mouse tissues, we find complex LSVs constitute over 30{\%} of tissue dependent transcript variations and affect specific protein families. We show the prevalence of complex LSVs is conserved in humans and identify hundreds of LSVs that are specific to brain subregions or altered in Alzheimer's patients. Amongst those are novel isoforms in the Camk2 family and a novel poison exon in Ptbp1, a key splice factor in neurogenesis. We anticipate the approach presented here will advance the ability to relate tissue-specific splice variation to genetic variation, phenotype, and disease.},

abstract = {Nanopore sequencing from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and Pacific BioSciences (PacBio) single-molecule real-Time (SMRT) long-read isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) are revolutionizing the way transcriptomes are analyzed. These methods offer many advantages over most widely used high-Throughput short-read RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) approaches and allow a comprehensive analysis of transcriptomes in identifying full-length splice isoforms and several other post-Transcriptional events. In addition, direct RNA-Seq provides valuable information about RNA modifications, which are lost during the PCR amplification step in other methods. Here, we present a comprehensive summary of important applications of these technologies in plants, including identification of complex alternative splicing (AS), full-length splice variants, fusion transcripts, and alternative polyadenylation (APA) events. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of the newly developed nanopore direct RNA-Seq in advancing epitranscriptome research in plants. Additionally, we summarize computational tools for identifying and quantifying full-length isoforms and other co/post-Transcriptional events and discussed some of the limitations with these methods. Sequencing of transcriptomes using these new single-molecule long-read methods will unravel many aspects of transcriptome complexity in unprecedented ways as compared to previous short-read sequencing approaches. Analysis of plant transcriptomes with these new powerful methods that require minimum sample processing is likely to become the norm and is expected to uncover novel co/post-Transcriptional gene regulatory mechanisms that control biological outcomes during plant development and in response to various stresses.},

abstract = {The 2012 neuropathological criteria for the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) summarize the extent of AD neuropathological change with an ABC score, which is a composite of the Thal stage of amyloid deposition (A), the Braak stage of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) (B), and the CERAD neuritic plaque score (C). NFTs and neuritic plaques are well-established contributors to cognitive impairment, but whether the Thal amyloid stage independently predicts antemortem cognition remains unknown. We used the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center autopsy data set to build adjacent-categories logit regression models with CDR-SOB and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores as cognitive outcome variables. Increasing CERAD scores were independently associated with higher CDR-SOB scores, whereas increasing Braak NFT stages predicted both higher CDR-SOB and lower MMSE scores. Increasing Thal amyloid stages were not significantly independently associated with either outcome measure. Increasing ABC scores predicted higher CDR-SOB and lower MMSE scores. These results raise the possibility that Thal amyloid stages do not substantially contribute to predicting antemortem cognition compared to CERAD neuritic plaque scores and Braak NFT stages, and suggest that the diffuse amyloid deposits participating in the assignment of Thal amyloid stages are neutral with respect to clinically detectable cognitive and functional changes.},

abstract = {Recent studies strongly indicate that aberrations in the control of gene expression might contribute to the initiation and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In particular, alternative splicing has been suggested to play a role in spontaneous cases of AD. Previous transcriptome profiling of AD models and patient samples using microarrays delivered conflicting results. This study provides, for the first time, transcriptomic analysis for distinct regions of the AD brain using RNA-Seq next-generation sequencing technology. Illumina RNA-Seq analysis was used to survey transcriptome profiles from total brain, frontal and temporal lobe of healthy and AD post-mortem tissue. We quantified gene expression levels, splicing isoforms and alternative transcript start sites. Gene Ontology term enrichment analysis revealed an overrepresentation of genes associated with a neuron's cytological structure and synapse function in AD brain samples. Analysis of the temporal lobe with the Cufflinks tool revealed that transcriptional isoforms of the apolipoprotein E gene, APOE-001, -002 and -005, are under the control of different promoters in normal and AD brain tissue. We also observed differing expression levels of APOE-001 and -002 splice variants in the AD temporal lobe. Our results indicate that alternative splicing and promoter usage of the APOE gene in AD brain tissue might reflect the progression of neurodegeneration.},

To our knowledge, this is the first report where quantitative information about particular splice variants at a genome-wide scale has been generated for different anatomical segments of normal and AD brains. Thus, our study creates a useful data set supplementing previous microarray-generated information, which lacked isoform- specific resolution of gene expression [9,41].

abstract = {To assess the performance of the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION sequencing platform, cDNAs from the External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC) RNA Spike-In mix were sequenced. This mix mimics mammalian mRNA species and consists of 92 polyadenylated transcripts with known concentration. cDNA libraries were generated using a template switching protocol to facilitate the direct comparison between different sequencing platforms. The MinION performance was assessed for its ability to sequence the cDNAs directly with good accuracy in terms of abundance and full length. The abundance of the ERCC cDNA molecules sequenced by MinION agreed with their expected concentration. No length or GC content bias was observed. The majority of cDNAs were sequenced as full length. Additionally, a complex cDNA population derived from a human HEK-293 cell line was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500, PacBio RS II and ONT MinION platforms. We observed that there was a good agreement in the measured cDNA abundance between PacBio RS II and ONT MinION (r pearson = 0.82, isoforms with length more than 700bp) and between Illumina HiSeq 2500 and ONT MinION (r pearson = 0.75). This indicates that the ONT MinION can sequence quantitatively both long and short full length cDNA molecules. Transcriptome sequencing using short read technologies (Illumina HiSeq 2500 1 , Ion Proton 2) provides valuable information on transcript abundance, rare transcripts and variable transcription start or end sites. Nevertheless, inferring alternatively spliced isoforms of genes from short read data through statistical assignment of the most probable combination of exons is still computationally challenging and not very accurate 3. Uneven read coverage 4 , complex splicing 5 and potential sequencing bias 6 complicates even more the task. The PacBio RS II 7 zero-mode waveguide (ZMW) long-read sequencing technology has proven capable of characterizing the transcriptome in its native, full-length form unravelling novel gene isoforms not previously observed in RNA-seq experiments 8. Recently, another long-read DNA sequencing technology based on nanopore sequencing (MinION) was introduced from Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd (ONT) 9. Similar to PacBio RS II, the ONT MinION has been shown that can resolve the exon structure of mRNA molecules transcribed from genes with a large variety of isoforms 10. Here, we assessed the ONT MinION performance for its ability to sequence the cDNAs with good accuracy in terms of cDNA abundance, sequence identity and in full length. To evaluate the performance of the ONT MinION platform, the cDNA of a commercially available defined set of 92 polyadenylated transcripts, that mimic mRNA species (ERCC RNA Spike-In mix), was sequenced with the Illumina HiSeq 2500 or MiSeq instruments, the PacBio RS II platform and the ONT MinION.

We demonstrate that combining low-coverage third-generation data from Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) with high-coverage paired read data is advantageous on simulated chromosomes. We apply MultiBreak-SV to PacBio data from four human fosmids and show that it detects known SVs with high sensitivity and specificity. Finally, we perform a whole-genome analysis on PacBio data from a complete hydatidiform mole cell line and predict 1002 high-probability SVs, over half of which are confirmed by an Illumina-based assembly.},

abstract = {Phosphorylated and proteolytically cleaved TDP-43 is a major component of the ubiquitin-positive inclusions in the most common pathological subtype of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-U). Intracellular accumulation of TDP-43 is observed in a subpopulation of patients with other dementia disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). However, the pathological significance of TDP-43 pathology in these disorders is unknown, since biochemical features of the TDP-43 accumulated in AD and DLB brains, especially its phosphorylation sites and pattern of fragmentation, are still unclear. To address these issues, we performed immunohistochemical and biochemical analyses of AD and DLB cases, using phosphorylation-dependent anti-TDP-43 antibodies. We found a higher frequency of pathological TDP-43 in AD (36-56{\%}) and in DLB (53-60{\%}) than previously reported. Of the TDP-43-positive cases, about 20-30{\%} showed neocortical TDP-43 pathology resembling the FTLD-U subtype associated with progranulin gene (PGRN) mutations. Immunoblot analyses of the sarkosyl-insoluble fraction from cases with neocortical TDP-43 pathology showed intense staining of several low-molecular-weight bands, corresponding to C-terminal fragments of TDP-43. Interestingly, the band pattern of these C-terminal fragments in AD and DLB also corresponds to that previously observed in the FTLD-U subtype associated with PGRN mutations. These results suggest that the morphological and biochemical features of TDP-43 pathology are common between AD or DLB and a specific subtype of FTLD-U. There may be genetic factors, such as mutations or genetic variants of PGRN underlying the co-occurrence of abnormal deposition of TDP-43, tau and $\alpha$-synuclein. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2008.},

abstract = {Background: Artificial duplicates from pyrosequencing reads may lead to incorrect interpretation of the abundance of species and genes in metagenomic studies. Duplicated reads were filtered out in many metagenomic projects. However, since the duplicated reads observed in a pyrosequencing run also include natural (non-artificial) duplicates, simply removing all duplicates may also cause underestimation of abundance associated with natural duplicates.Results: We implemented a method for identification of exact and nearly identical duplicates from pyrosequencing reads. This method performs an all-against-all sequence comparison and clusters the duplicates into groups using an algorithm modified from our previous sequence clustering method cd-hit. This method can process a typical dataset in {\~{}}10 minutes; it also provides a consensus sequence for each group of duplicates. We applied this method to the underlying raw reads of 39 genomic projects and 10 metagenomic projects that utilized pyrosequencing technique. We compared the occurrences of the duplicates identified by our method and the natural duplicates made by independent simulations. We observed that the duplicates, including both artificial and natural duplicates, make up 4-44{\%} of reads. The number of natural duplicates highly correlates with the samples' read density (number of reads divided by genome size). For high-complexity metagenomic samples lacking dominant species, natural duplicates only make up {\textless}1{\%} of all duplicates. But for some other samples like transcriptomic samples, majority of the observed duplicates might be natural duplicates.Conclusions: Our method is available from http://cd-hit.org as a downloadable program and a web server. It is important not only to identify the duplicates from metagenomic datasets but also to distinguish whether they are artificial or natural duplicates. We provide a tool to estimate the number of natural duplicates according to user-defined sample types, so users can decide whether to retain or remove duplicates in their projects. {\textcopyright} 2010 Niu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

By contrast, sequencing technology can provide un-biased analysis of transcription at nucleotide resolution. Here we use this approach to investigate schizophrenia-associated cortical gene expression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The data was generated from 76 bp reads of RNA-Seq, aligned to the reference genome and assembled into transcripts for quantification of exons, splice variants and alternative promoters in postmortem superior temporal gyrus (STG/BA22) from 9 male subjects with schizophrenia and 9 matched non-psychiatric controls. Differentially expressed genes were then subjected to further sequence and functional group analysis. The output, amounting to more than 38 Gb of sequence, revealed significant alteration of gene expression including many previously shown to be associated with schizophrenia. Gene ontology enrichment analysis followed by functional map construction identified three functional clusters highly relevant to schizophrenia including neurotransmission related functions, synaptic vesicle trafficking, and neural development. Significantly, more than 2000 genes displayed schizophrenia-associated alternative promoter usage and more than 1000 genes showed differential splicing (FDR{\textless}0.05). Both types of transcriptional isoforms were exemplified by reads aligned to the neurodevelopmentally significant doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) gene.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This study provided the first deep and un-biased analysis of schizophrenia-associated transcriptional diversity within the STG, and revealed variants with important implications for the complex pathophysiology of schizophrenia.},

An ionic current passing through a small pore would directly map the sequence of single stranded DNA (ssDNA) driven through the constriction. The pore protein, MspA, derived from Mycobacterium smegmatis, has a short and narrow channel constriction ideally suited for nanopore sequencing. To study MspA's ability to resolve nucleotides, we held ssDNA within the pore using a biotin-NeutrAvidin complex. We show that homopolymers of adenine, cytosine, thymine, and guanine in MspA exhibit much larger current differences than in $\alpha$-hemolysin. Additionally, methylated cytosine is distinguishable from unmethylated cytosine. We establish that single nucleotide substitutions within homopolymer ssDNA can be detected when held in MspA's constriction. Using genomic single nucleotide polymorphisms, we demonstrate that single nucleotides within random DNA can be identified. Our results indicate that MspA has high signal-to-noise ratio and the single nucleotide sensitivity desired for nanopore sequencing devices. {\textcopyright} 2011 Manrao et al.},

abstract = {Reactive astrocytes are strongly induced by central nervous system (CNS) injury and disease, but their role is poorly understood. Here we show that a subtype of reactive astrocytes, which we termed A1, is induced by classically activated neuroinflammatory microglia. We show that activated microglia induce A1 astrocytes by secreting Il-1$\alpha$, TNF and C1q, and that these cytokines together are necessary and sufficient to induce A1 astrocytes. A1 astrocytes lose the ability to promote neuronal survival, outgrowth, synaptogenesis and phagocytosis, and induce the death of neurons and oligodendrocytes. Death of axotomized CNS neurons in vivo is prevented when the formation of A1 astrocytes is blocked. Finally, we show that A1 astrocytes are abundant in various human neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's, Huntington's and Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis. Taken together these findings help to explain why CNS neurons die after axotomy, strongly suggest that A1 astrocytes contribute to the death of neurons and oligodendrocytes in neurodegenerative disorders, and provide opportunities for the development of new treatments for these diseases.},

An incomplete duck reference genome and very limited availability of full-length cDNAs has hindered the identification of alternatively spliced transcripts and slowed down many basic studies in ducks. We applied PacBio Iso-Seq technologies to multiple tissues from duck for use in transcriptome sequencing. We obtained 199,993 full-length transcripts and comprehensively annotated these transcripts. 23,755 lncRNAs were predicted from all identified transcripts and 35,031 alternative splicing events, which divided into 5 models, were accurately predicted from 3,346 genes. Our data constitute a large increase in the known number of both lncRNA, and alternatively spliced transcripts of duck and plays an important role in improving current genome annotation. In addition, the data will be extremely useful for functional studies in other birds.},

abstract = {Given that the majority of multi-exon genes generate diverse functional products, it is important to evaluate expression at the isoform level. Previous studies have demonstrated strong gene-level correlations between RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and microarray platforms, but have not studied their concordance at the isoform level. We performed transcript abundance estimation on raw RNA-seq and exon-array expression profiles available for common glioblastoma multiforme samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas using different analysis pipelines, and compared both the isoform- and gene-level expression estimates between programs and platforms. The results showed better concordance between RNA-seq/exon-array and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) platforms for fold change estimates than for raw abundance estimates, suggesting that fold change normalization against a control is an important step for integrating expression data across platforms. Based on RT-qPCR validations, eXpress and Multi-Mapping Bayesian Gene eXpression (MMBGX) programs achieved the best performance for RNA-seq and exon-array platforms, respectively, for deriving the isoform-level fold change values. While eXpress achieved the highest correlation with the RT-qPCR and exon-array (MMBGX) results overall, RSEM was more highly correlated with MMBGX for the subset of transcripts that are highly variable across the samples. eXpress appears to be most successful in discriminating lowly expressed transcripts, but IsoformEx and RSEM correlate more strongly with MMBGX for highly expressed transcripts. The results also reinforce how potentially important isoform-level expression changes can be masked by gene-level estimates, and demonstrate that exon arrays yield comparable results to RNA-seq for evaluating isoform-level expression changes.},

abstract = {Next-generation RNA sequencing technologies have been widely applied in transcriptome profiling. This facilitates further studies of gene structure and expression on the genome wide scale. It is an important step to align reads to the reference genome and call out splicing junctions for the following analysis, such as the analysis of alternative splicing and isoform construction. However, because of the existence of introns, when RNA-seq reads are aligned to the reference genome, reads can not be fully mapped at splicing sites. Thus, it is challenging to align reads and call out splicing junctions accurately. In this paper, we present a classification based approach for calling splicing junctions from RNA-seq data, which is implemented in the program SpliceJumper. SpliceJumper uses a machine learning approach which combines multiple features extracted from RNA-seq data. We compare SpliceJumper with two existing RNA-seq analysis approaches, TopHat2 and MapSplice2, on both simulated and real data. Our results show that SpliceJumper outperforms TopHat2 and MapSplice2 in accuracy. The program SpliceJumper can be downloaded at https://github.com/Reedwarbler/SpliceJumper .},

abstract = {Most human genes generate multiple transcript isoforms. The differential expression of these isoforms can help specify cell types. Diverse transcript isoforms arise from the use of alternative transcription start sites, polyadenylation sites and splice sites; however, the relative contribution of these processes to isoform diversity in normal human physiology is unclear. To address this question, we investigated cell type-dependent differences in exon usage of over 18 000 protein-coding genes in 23 cell types from 798 samples of the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project. We found that about half of the expressed genes displayed tissue-dependent transcript isoforms. Alternative transcription start and termination sites, rather than alternative splicing, accounted for the majority of tissue-dependent exon usage. We confirmed the widespread tissue-dependent use of alternative transcription start sites in a second, independent dataset, Cap Analysis of Gene Expression data from the FANTOM consortium. Moreover, our results indicate that most tissue-dependent splicing involves untranslated exons and therefore may not increase proteome complexity. Thus, alternative transcription start and termination sites are the principal drivers of transcript isoform diversity across tissues, and may underlie the majority of cell type specific proteomes and functions.},

abstract = {Genes in prokaryotic genomes are often arranged into clusters and co-transcribed into polycistronic RNAs. Isolated examples of polycistronic RNAs were also reported in some higher eukaryotes but their presence was generally considered rare. Here we developed a long-read sequencing strategy to identify polycistronic transcripts in several mushroom forming fungal species including Plicaturopsis crispa, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Trametes versicolor, and Gloeophyllum trabeum. We found genome-wide prevalence of polycistronic transcription in these Agaricomycetes, involving up to 8{\%} of the transcribed genes. Unlike polycistronic mRNAs in prokaryotes, these co-transcribed genes are also independently transcribed. We show that polycistronic transcription may interfere with expression of the downstream tandem gene. Further comparative genomic analysis indicates that polycistronic transcription is conserved among a wide range of mushroom forming fungi. In summary, our study revealed, for the first time, the genome prevalence of polycistronic transcription in a phylogenetic range of higher fungi. Furthermore, we systematically show that our long-read sequencing approach and combined bioinformatics pipeline is a generic powerful tool for precise characterization of complex transcriptomes that enables identification of mRNA isoforms not recovered via short-read assembly.},

abstract = {Background: Alternative splicing (AS) functions to expand proteomic complexity and plays numerous important roles in gene regulation. However, the extent to which AS coordinates functions in a cell and tissue type specific manner is not known. Moreover, the sequence code that underlies cell and tissue type specific regulation of AS is poorly understood. Results: Using quantitative AS microarray profiling, we have identified a large number of widely expressed mouse genes that contain single or coordinated pairs of alternative exons that are spliced in a tissue regulated fashion. The majority of these AS events display differential regulation in central nervous system (CNS) tissues. Approximately half of the corresponding genes have neural specific functions and operate in common processes and interconnected pathways. Differential regulation of AS in the CNS tissues correlates strongly with a set of mostly new motifs that are predominantly located in the intron and constitutive exon sequences neighboring CNS-regulated alternative exons. Different subsets of these motifs are correlated with either increased inclusion or increased exclusion of alternative exons in CNS tissues, relative to the other profiled tissues. Conclusion: Our findings provide new evidence that specific cellular processes in the mammalian CNS are coordinated at the level of AS, and that a complex splicing code underlies CNS specific AS regulation. This code appears to comprise many new motifs, some of which are located in the constitutive exons neighboring regulated alternative exons. These data provide a basis for understanding the molecular mechanisms by which the tissue specific functions of widely expressed genes are coordinated at the level of AS. {\textcopyright} 2007 Fagnani et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

We integrated multiple genome and transcriptome assembly technologies to narrow the causal mutation to the TAF1 locus, which included a SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) retrotransposition into intron 32 of the gene. Transcriptome analyses identified decreased expression of the canonical cTAF1 transcript among XDP probands, and de novo assembly across multiple pluripotent stem-cell-derived neuronal lineages discovered aberrant TAF1 transcription that involved alternative splicing and intron retention (IR) in proximity to the SVA that was anti-correlated with overall TAF1 expression. CRISPR/Cas9 excision of the SVA rescued this XDP-specific transcriptional signature and normalized TAF1 expression in probands. These data suggest an SVA-mediated aberrant transcriptional mechanism associated with XDP and may provide a roadmap for layered technologies and integrated assembly-based analyses for other unsolved Mendelian disorders.

The advent of high-throughput" transcriptome investigation technologies such as microarray and deep sequencing is increasingly being combined with sophisticated statistical and bioinformatics analysis methods complemented by knowledge-based approaches such as Bayesian Networks or network and graph analyses.Together, such integrative" studies are beginning to identify co-regulated gene networks linked with biological pathways and potentially modulating disease predisposition, outcome, and progression. Specifically, bioinformatics analyses of integrated microarray and genotyping data in cases and controls reveal changes in gene expression of both protein-coding and small and long regulatory RNAs; highlight relevant quantitative transcriptional differences between LOAD and non-demented control brains and demonstrate reconfiguration of functionally meaningful molecular interaction structures in LOAD.These may be measured as changes in connectivity in hub nodes" of relevant gene networks (Zhang etal., 2013).We illustrate here the open analytical questions in the transcriptome investigation of neurodegenerative disease studies, proposing ad hoc" strategies for the evaluation of differential gene expression and hints for a simple analysis of the non-coding RNA (ncRNA) part of such datasets. We then survey the emerging role of long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) in the healthy and diseased brain transcriptome and describe the main current methods for computational modeling of gene networks. We propose accessible modular and pathway-oriented methods and guidelines for bioinformatics investigations of whole transcriptome next generation sequencing datasets. We finally present methods and databases for functional interpretations of lncRNAs and propose a simple heuristic approach to visualize and represent physical and functional interactions of the coding and non-coding components of the transcriptome.

Now, RNA-seq methods are available for studying many different aspects of RNA biology, including single-cell gene expression, translation (the translatome) and RNA structure (the structurome). Exciting new applications are being explored, such as spatial transcriptomics (spatialomics). Together with new long-read and direct RNA-seq technologies and better computational tools for data analysis, innovations in RNA-seq are contributing to a fuller understanding of RNA biology, from questions such as when and where transcription occurs to the folding and intermolecular interactions that govern RNA function.},

Coexpression networks isolate disease-specific neuronal alterations, as well as microglial, astrocyte, and interferon-response modules defining previously unidentified neural-immune mechanisms.We integrated genetic and genomic data to perform a transcriptome-wide association study, prioritizing disease loci likelymediated by cis effects on brain expression.This transcriptome-wide characterization of the molecular pathology across three major psychiatric disorders provides a comprehensive resource for mechanistic insight and therapeutic development.},

abstract = {Most human protein-coding genes are expressed as multiple isoforms, which greatly expands the functional repertoire of the encoded proteome. While at least one reliable open reading frame (ORF) model has been assigned for every coding gene, the majority of alternative isoforms remains uncharacterized due to (i) vast differences of overall levels between different isoforms expressed from common genes, and (ii) the difficulty of obtaining full-length transcript sequences. Here, we present ORF Capture-Seq (OCS), a flexible method that addresses both challenges for targeted full-length isoform sequencing applications using collections of cloned ORFs as probes. As a proof-of-concept, we show that an OCS pipeline focused on genes coding for transcription factors increases isoform detection by an order of magnitude when compared to unenriched samples. In short, OCS enables rapid discovery of isoforms from custom-selected genes and will accelerate mapping of the human transcriptome.},

We have performed a comprehensive transcriptome profiling of Late-Onset AD (LOAD) patients using second generation sequencing technologies, identifying 2,064 genes, 47 lncRNAs and 4 miRNAs whose expression is specifically deregulated in the hippocampal region of LOAD patients. Moreover, analyzing the hippocampal, temporal and frontal regions from the same LOAD patients, we identify specific sets of deregulated miRNAs for each region, and we confirm that the miR-132/212 cluster is deregulated in each of these regions in LOAD patients, consistent with these miRNAs playing a role in AD pathogenesis. Notably, a luciferase assay indicates that miR-184 is able to target the 3'UTR NR4A2 - which is known to be involved in cognitive functions and long-term memory and whose expression levels are inversely correlated with those of miR-184 in the hippocampus. Finally, RNA editing analysis reveals a general RNA editing decrease in LOAD hippocampus, with 14 recoding sites significantly and differentially edited in 11 genes. Our data underline specific transcriptional changes in LOAD brain and provide an important source of information for understanding the molecular changes characterizing LOAD progression.},

Standard assumption of uniform read intensity would yield biased estimates when the read intensity is in fact non-uniform. The problem is that, without strong assumptions, the read intensity pattern is not identifiable from data observed in a single sample.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We develop a joint statistical model that accounts for non-uniform isoform-specific read distribution and gene isoform expression estimation. The main challenge is in dealing with the large number of isoform-specific read distributions, which potentially are as many as the number of splice variants in the genome. A statistical regularization via a smoothing penalty is imposed to control the estimation. Also, for identifiability reasons, the method uses information across samples from the same region. We develop a fast and robust computational procedure based on the iterated-weighted least-squares algorithm, and apply it to simulated data and two real RNA-Seq datasets with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction validation. Empirical tests show that our model performs better than existing methods in terms of increasing precision in isoform-level estimation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: We have implemented our method in an R package called Sequgio as a pipeline for fast processing of RNA-Seq data.},

We sequenced transcriptomes of 72 prefrontal cortex samples across six life stages and identified 50,650 differentially expression regions (DERs) associated with developmental and aging, agnostic of annotation. While many DERs annotated to non-exonic sequence (41.1{\%}), most were similarly regulated in cytosolic mRNA extracted from independent samples. The DERs were developmentally conserved across 16 brain regions and in the developing mouse cortex, and were expressed in diverse cell and tissue types. The DERs were further enriched for active chromatin marks and clinical risk for neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia. Lastly, we demonstrate quantitatively that these DERs associate with a changing neuronal phenotype related to differentiation and maturation. These data show conserved molecular signatures of transcriptional dynamics across brain development, have potential clinical relevance and highlight the incomplete annotation of the human brain transcriptome.},

Large-scale genome wide association studies (GWAS) for LOAD have identified 10 novel risk genes: ABCA7, BIN1, CD2AP, CD33, CLU, CR1, EPHA1, MS4A6A, MS4A6E, and PICALM. We sought to measure the influence of GWAS single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and gene expression levels on clinical and pathological measures of AD in brain tissue from the parietal lobe of AD cases and age-matched, cognitively normal controls. We found that ABCA7, CD33, and CR1 expression levels were associated with clinical dementia rating (CDR), with higher expression being associated with more advanced cognitive decline. BIN1 expression levels were associated with disease progression, where higher expression was associated with a delayed age at onset. CD33, CLU, and CR1 expression levels were associated with disease status, where elevated expression levels were associated with AD. Additionally, MS4A6A expression levels were associated with Braak tangle and Braak plaque scores, with elevated expression levels being associated with more advanced brain pathology. We failed to detect an association between GWAS SNPs and gene expression levels in our brain series. The minor allele of rs3764650 in ABCA7 is associated with age at onset and disease duration, and the minor allele of rs670139 in MS4A6E was associated with Braak tangle and Braak plaque score. These findings suggest that expression of some GWAS genes, namely ABCA7, BIN1, CD33, CLU, CR1 and the MS4A family, are altered in AD brains. {\textcopyright} 2012 Karch et al.},

abstract = {Background: At least 90{\%} of human genes are alternatively spliced. Alternative splicing has an important function regulating gene expression and miss-splicing can contribute to risk for human diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: We developed a splicing decision model as a molecular mechanism to identify functional exon skipping events and genetic variation affecting alternative splicing on a genome-wide scale by integrating genomics, transcriptomics, and neuroimaging data in a systems biology approach. In this study, we analyzed RNA-Seq data of hippocampus brain tissue from Alzheimer's disease (AD; n = 24) and cognitively normal elderly controls (CN; n = 50) and identified three exon skipping events in two genes (RELN and NOS1) as significantly associated with AD (corrected p-value {\textless} 0.05 and fold change {\textgreater} 1.5). Next, we identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting exon skipping events using the splicing decision model and then performed an association analysis of SNPs potentially affecting three exon skipping events with a global cortical measure of amyloid-$\beta$ deposition measured by [ 18 F] Florbetapir position emission tomography (PET) scan as an AD-related quantitative phenotype. A whole-brain voxel-based analysis was also performed. Results: Two exons in RELN and one exon in NOS1 showed significantly lower expression levels in the AD participants compared to CN participants, suggesting that the exons tend to be skipped more in AD. We also showed the loss of the core protein structure due to the skipped exons using the protein 3D structure analysis. The targeted SNP-based association analysis identified one intronic SNP (rs362771) adjacent to the skipped exon 24 in RELN as significantly associated with cortical amyloid-$\beta$ levels (corrected p-value {\textless} 0.05). This SNP is within the splicing regulatory element, i.e., intronic splicing enhancer. The minor allele of rs362771 conferred decreases in cortical amyloid-$\beta$ levels in the right temporal and bilateral parietal lobes. Conclusions: Our results suggest that exon skipping events and splicing-affecting SNPs in the human hippocampus may contribute to AD pathogenesis. Integration of multiple omics and neuroimaging data provides insights into possible mechanisms underlying AD pathophysiology through exon skipping and may help identify novel therapeutic targets.},

Resulting data represents the consequence of transcriptional regulation in each analyzed state of mammalian cells. Non-overlapping peaks over the CAGE profiles, approximately 200,000 and 150,000 peaks for the human and mouse genomes, were identified and annotated to provide precise location of known promoters as well as novel ones, and to quantify their activities.},

This scheme has not been applied to the assessment of TDP-43 pathology in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and aged controls. We investigated TDP-43 pathology prevalence and severity in AD, DLB, mixed AD/DLB (Mx AD/DLB) and aged controls. One hundred and nineteen human post-mortem brains were included, neuropathologically diagnosed as AD: 46, DLB: 15, Mx AD/DLB: 19 and aged controls: 39. Paraffin sections inclusive of the amygdala, hippocampus, striatum and neocortex were immunohistochemically stained with antibodies against phosphorylated TDP-43 and staged according to the TDP-43 in AD staging scheme. TDP-43 pathology was present in all groups: AD: 73.9{\%}, DLB: 33.3{\%}, Mx AD/DLB: 52.6{\%} and controls: 17.9{\%}. Prevalence of TDP-43 pathology was significantly higher in AD and Mx AD/DLB compared to controls. In controls, higher age at death was associated with prevalence of TDP-43 pathology and higher TDP-43 in AD stage, suggesting that this type of TDP-43 pathology may partly be an age-associated phenomenon. Significantly higher prevalence of TDP-43 pathology in the AD group indicates that AD pathology possibly triggers and aggravates TDP-43 pathology. The validity of the TDP-43 in AD staging scheme is not limited to AD and should be applied to assess TDP-43 pathology in post mortem brains of aged individuals to further elucidate the role of TDP-43 pathology in age associated neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing is a pervasive process in eukaryotic organisms. More than 90{\%} of human genes have alternatively spliced products, and aberrant splicing has been shown to be associated with many diseases. Current methods employed in the detection of splice variants include prediction by clustering of expressed sequence tags, exon microarray, and mRNA sequencing, all methods focusing on RNA-level information. There is a lack of tools for analyzing splice variants at the protein level. Here, we present SpliceVista, a tool for splice variant identification and visualization based on mass spectrometry proteomics data. SpliceVista retrieves gene structure and translated sequences from alternative splicing databases and maps MS-identified peptides to splice variants. The visualization module plots the exon composition of each splice variant and aligns identified peptides with transcript positions. If quantitative mass spectrometry data are used, SpliceVista plots the quantitative patterns for each peptide and provides users with the option to cluster peptides based on their quantitative patterns. SpliceVista can identify splice-variant-specific peptides, providing the possibility for variant-specific analysis. The tool was tested on two experimental datasets (PXD000065 and PXD000134). In A431 cells treated with gefitinib, 2983 splice-variant-specific peptides corresponding to 939 splice variants were identified. Through comparison of splice-variant-centric, protein-centric, and gene-centric quantification, several genes (e.g. EIF4H) were found to have differentially regulated splice variants after gefitinib treatment. The same discrepancy between protein-centric and splice-centric quantification was detected in the other dataset, in which induced pluripotent stem cells were compared with parental fibroblast and human embryotic stem cells. In addition, SpliceVista can be used to visualize novel splice variants inferred from peptide-level evidence. In summary, SpliceVista enables visualization, detection, and differential quantification of protein splice variants that are often missed in current proteomics pipelines.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We used RNA sequencing to analyze transcript profiles of ten autopsy brain regions from ten subjects. RNA sequencing techniques were designed to detect both coding and non-coding RNA, splice isoform composition, and allelic expression. Brain regions were selected from five subjects with a documented history of smoking and five non-smokers. Paired-end RNA sequencing was performed on SOLiD instruments to a depth of {\textgreater}40 million reads, using linearly amplified, ribosomally depleted RNA. Sequencing libraries were prepared with both poly-dT and random hexamer primers to detect all RNA classes, including long non-coding (lncRNA), intronic and intergenic transcripts, and transcripts lacking poly-A tails, providing additional data not previously available. The study was designed to generate a database of the complete transcriptomes in brain region for gene network analyses and discovery of regulatory variants.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Of 20,318 protein coding and 18,080 lncRNA genes annotated from GENCODE and lncipedia, 12 thousand protein coding and 2 thousand lncRNA transcripts were detectable at a conservative threshold. Of the aligned reads, 52 {\%} were exonic, 34 {\%} intronic and 14 {\%} intergenic. A majority of protein coding genes (65 {\%}) was expressed in all regions, whereas ncRNAs displayed a more restricted distribution. Profiles of RNA isoforms varied across brain regions and subjects at multiple gene loci, with neurexin 3 (NRXN3) a prominent example. Allelic RNA ratios deviating from unity were identified in {\textgreater} 400 genes, detectable in both protein-coding and non-coding genes, indicating the presence of cis-acting regulatory variants. Mathematical modeling was used to identify RNAs stably expressed in all brain regions (serving as potential markers for normalizing expression levels), linked to basic cellular functions. An initial analysis of differential expression analysis between smokers and nonsmokers implicated a number of genes, several previously associated with nicotine exposure.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: RNA sequencing identifies distinct and consistent differences in gene expression between brain regions, with non-coding RNA displaying greater diversity between brain regions than mRNAs. Numerous RNAs exhibit robust allele selective expression, proving a means for discovery of cis-acting regulatory factors with potential clinical relevance.},

abstract = {Mutations in the tau gene are known to cosegregate with the disease in frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). However, the molecular mechanism by which these mutations might lead to the disease is not understood. Here, we show that four of the FTDP-17 tau mutations, R406W, V337M, G272V, and P301L, result in tau proteins that are more favorable substrates for phosphorylation by brain protein kinases than the wild-type, largest four-repeat protein $\tau$4L and $\tau$4L more than $\tau$3L. In general, at all the sites studied, mutant tau proteins were phosphorylated faster and to a higher extent than $\tau$4L and $\tau$4L {\textgreater} $\tau$3L. The most dramatic difference found was in the rate and level of phosphorylation of $\tau$4L R406W at positions Ser-396, Ser-400, Thr-403, and Ser-404. Phosphorylation of this mutant tau was 12 times faster and 400{\%} greater at Ser-396 and less than 30{\%} at Ser-400, Thr-403, and Ser-404 than phosphorylation of $\tau$4L. The mutated tau proteins polymerized into filaments when 4-6 mol of phosphate per mol of tau were incorporated, whereas wild-type tau required ∼10 mol of phosphate per mol of protein to self-assemble. Mutated and wild-type tau proteins were able to sequester normal tau upon incorporation of ∼4 mol of phosphate per mol of protein, which was achieved at as early as 30 min of phosphorylation in the case of mutant tau proteins. These findings taken together suggest that the mutations in tau might cause neurodegeneration by making the protein a more favorable substrate for hyperphosphorylation.},

abstract = {Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease with pathological hallmarks including the formation of extracellular aggregates of amyloid-beta (A$\beta$) known as plaques and intracellular tau tangles. Coincident with the formation of A$\beta$ plaques is recruitment and activation of glial cells to the plaque forming a plaque niche. In addition to histological data showing the formation of the niche, AD genetic studies have added to the growing appreciation of how dysfunctional glia pathways drive neuropathology, with emphasis on microglia pathways. Genomic approaches enable comparisons of human disease profiles between different mouse models informing on their utility to evaluate secondary changes to triggers such as A$\beta$ deposition. Methods: In this study, we utilized two animal models of AD to examine and characterize the AD-associated pathology: the Tg2576 Swedish APP (KM670/671NL) and TgCRND8 Swedish plus Indiana APP (KM670/671NL+V717F) lines. We used laser capture microscopy (LCM) to isolate samples surrounding Thio-S positive plaques from distal non-plaque tissue. These samples were then analyzed using RNA sequencing. Results: We determined age-associated transcriptomic differences between two similar yet distinct APP transgenic mouse models, known to differ in proportional amyloidogenic species and plaque deposition rates. In Tg2576, human AD gene signatures were not observed despite profiling mice out to 15months of age. TgCRND8 mice however showed progressive and robust induction of lysomal, neuroimmune, and ITIM/ITAM-associated gene signatures overlapping with prior human AD brain transcriptomic studies. Notably, RNAseq analyses highlighted the vast majority of transcriptional changes observed in aging TgCRND8 cortical brain homogenates were in fact specifically enriched within the plaque niche samples. Data uncovered plaque-associated enrichment of microglia-related genes such as ITIM/ITAM-associated genes and pathway markers of phagocytosis. Conclusion: This work may help guide improved translational value of APP mouse models of AD, particularly for strategies aimed at targeting neuroimmune and neurodegenerative pathways, by demonstrating that TgCRND8 more closely recapitulates specific human AD-associated transcriptional responses.},

An increasing body of literature has demonstrated a major role for IR in numerous biological functions, including several that impact human health and disease. Although experimental technologies used to study other forms of mRNA splicing can also be used to investigate IR, a specialized downstream computational analysis is optimal for IR discovery and analysis. Here we provide a review of IR and its biological implications, as well as a practical guide for how to detect and analyze it. Several methods, including long read third generation direct RNA sequencing, are described. We have developed an R package, FakIR, to facilitate the execution of the bioinformatic tasks recommended in this review and a tutorial on how to fit them to users aims. Additionally, we provide guidelines and experimental protocols to validate IR discovery and to evaluate the potential impact of IR on gene expression and protein output.

abstract = {The 39- to 43-amino acid amyloid $\beta$-protein (A$\beta$) is deposited as amyloid in Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies have suggested that short A$\beta$ (A$\beta$39 or A$\beta$40) and long A$\beta$ (A$\beta$42 or A$\beta$43) play different roles in Alzheimer-type pathology. However, little attempt has been made to investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying the generation of short and long A$\beta$ individually. In the present report, we first measured the amount of short and long A$\beta$ that are secreted from wild-type human and rodent cells with neuron- or glia-like properties using highly sensitive sandwich-ELISAs that discriminate long A$\beta$ from short A$\beta$. The results showed that long A$\beta$ secreted by all cells constitutes approximately 10{\%} of the total A$\beta$. To identify the molecular species of long A$\beta$, we next isolated the A$\beta$ species secreted from human neuroblastoma IMR-32 cells by affinity chromatography, gel-filtration HPLC, and reversephase HPLC. Mass spectrometric analysis demonstrated unequivocally that IMR-32 cells produce A$\beta$1-42 together with A$\beta$1-37, A$\beta$1-38, A$\beta$1-39, and most predominantly, A$\beta$1-40. Finally, to investigate the cellular mechanisms that generate A$\beta$1-42, we studied the effects of brefeldin A and monensin on the production of A$\beta$1-40 and A$\beta$1-42 in IMR-32 cells. These reagents reduced the production of both A$\beta$1-40 and A$\beta$1-42 simultaneously in a concentration-dependent manner. These results indicate that processing of wild-type amyloid precursor protein normally generates A$\beta$1-42 at a ratio of 10{\%} to total A$\beta$ and that A$\beta$1-40 and A$\beta$1-42 share a common secretory mechanism that involves acidic compartments such as the late Golgi or early endosomes. {\textcopyright} 1995, American Chemical Society.

The feeding behaviors of Coullana sp., Cletocamptus deitersi, Microarthridion littorale, and Pseudostenhelia wellsi were examined using C-14-radiotracer grazing experiments and gut-pigment analyses. In one grazing experiment, laboratory-cultured microalgae were labeled using (NaHCO3)-C-14 and injected into intact sediment cores to determine whether copepods were grazing on algae from the water column and/or at the sediment-water interface. In another grazing experiment, (NaHCO3)-C-14 was injected directly into sediment cores and grazing on C-14-labeled natural algae was measured. Fluorometric analyses of gut pigments were used to determine the recent feeding histories of copepods. Functional responses of copepod feeding to variation in sedimentary chlorophyll (chi) a concentrations were also used to discern interspecific differences in feeding. Coullana sp. grazed on microalgae from the water-column and at the sediment-water interface. C. deitersi grazed predominantly on microalgae from the sediment-water interface. Grazing on laboratory-cultured algae was minimal in M. littorale and I! wellsi, but grazing experiments with C-14-labeled natural algae and gut-pigment analyses indicated that these copepods grazed on microalgae in the field. However, a positive functional response to chi a concentrations by M, littorale and a lack of a functional response by P. wellsi suggest that these 2 species exploit algal resources differently. Collectively, our observations indicate that each copepod species examined exploits microalgal resources differently.},

Yet these only explain a small proportion of the genetic variance, indicating that undiscovered loci remain. Here, we performed a large genome-wide association study of clinically diagnosed AD and AD-by-proxy (71,880 cases, 383,378 controls). AD-by-proxy, based on parental diagnoses, showed strong genetic correlation with AD (rg = 0.81). Meta-analysis identified 29 risk loci, implicating 215 potential causative genes. Associated genes are strongly expressed in immune-related tissues and cell types (spleen, liver, and microglia). Gene-set analyses indicate biological mechanisms involved in lipid-related processes and degradation of amyloid precursor proteins.

abstract = {The abundance of mRNA is mainly determined by the rates of RNA transcription and decay. Here, we present a method for unbiased estimation of differential mRNA decay rate from RNA-sequencing data by modeling the kinetics of mRNA metabolism. We show that in all primary human tissues tested, and particularly in the central nervous system, many pathways are regulated at the mRNA stability level. We present a parsimonious regulatory model consisting of two RNA-binding proteins and four microRNAs that modulate the mRNA stability landscape of the brain, which suggests a new link between RBFOX proteins and Alzheimer's disease. We show that downregulation of RBFOX1 leads to destabilization of mRNAs encoding for synaptic transmission proteins, which may contribute to the loss of synaptic function in Alzheimer's disease. RBFOX1 downregulation is more likely to occur in older and female individuals, consistent with the association of Alzheimer's disease with age and gender.},

abstract = {Motivation: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases.Results: To align our large ({\textgreater}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {\textgreater}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90{\%} success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.

abstract = {Transcription of a gene usually ends at a regulated termination point, preventing the RNA-polymerase from reading through the next gene. However, sporadic reports suggest that chimeric transcripts, formed by transcription of two consecutive genes into one RNA, can occur in human. The splicing and translation of such RNAs can lead to a new, fused protein, having domains from both original proteins. Here, we systematically identified over 200 cases of intergenic splicing in the human genome (involving 421 genes), and experimentally demonstrated that at least half of these fusions exist in human tissues. We showed that unique splicing patterns dominate the functional and regulatory nature of the resulting transcripts, and found intergenic distance bias in fused compared with nonfused genes. We demonstrate that the hundreds of fused genes we identified are only a subset of the actual number of fused genes in human. We describe a novel evolutionary mechanism where transcription-induced chimerism followed by retroposition results in a new, active fused gene. Finally, we provide evidence that transcription-induced chimerism can be a mechanism contributing to the evolution of protein complexes. {\textcopyright}2006 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Twin studies using selected samples have shown high heritability for Alzheimer disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate genetic and environmental influences on AD in a fully ascertained population of older twins, including like- and unlike-sex pairs. DESIGN: Five-group quantitative genetic model: male monozygotic twins, female monozygotic twins, male dizygotic twins, female dizygotic twins, and unlike-sex twins. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: All twins in the Swedish Twin Registry aged 65 years and older. The study included 11,884 twin pairs, among whom were 392 pairs in which 1 or both members had AD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All individuals were screened for cognitive dysfunction. Suspected cases of dementia and their co-twins received complete clinical diagnostic evaluations for AD. Estimates of heritability, shared environmental influences, and nonshared environmental influences, adjusting for age, were derived from the twin data. RESULTS: Heritability for AD was estimated to be 58{\%} in the full model and 79{\%} in the best-fitting model, with the balance of variation explained by nonshared environmental influences. There were no significant differences between men and women in prevalence or heritability after controlling for age. Within pairs concordant for AD, intrapair difference in age at onset was significantly greater in dizygotic than in monozygotic pairs, suggesting genetic influences on timing of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: In the largest twin study to date, we confirmed that heritability for AD is high and that the same genetic factors are influential for both men and women. However, nongenetic risk factors also play an important role and might be the focus for interventions to reduce disease risk or delay disease onset.},

The dysregulated splicing particularly affects genes involved in synaptic transmission. The effects of neuroprotective TIA1 reduction on PS19 mice are also examined. TIA1 reduction reduces disease-linked alternative splicing events for the major synaptic mRNA transcripts examined, suggesting that normalization of RBP functions is associated with the neuroprotection. Use of the NetDecoder informatics algorithm identifies key upstream biological targets, including MYC and EGFR, underlying the transcriptional and splicing changes in the protected compared to tauopathy mice. Pharmacological inhibition of MYC and EGFR activity in neuronal cultures tau recapitulates the neuroprotective effects of TIA1 reduction. These results demonstrate that dysfunction of RBPs and RNA splicing processes are major elements of the pathophysiology of tauopathies, as well as potential therapeutic targets for tauopathies.},

abstract = {Gene fusion occurs when two or more individual genes with independent open reading frames becoming juxtaposed under the same open reading frame creating a new fused gene. A small number of gene fusions described in detail have been associated with novel functions, for example, the hominid-specific PIPSL gene, TNFSF12, and the TWE-PRIL gene family. We use Sequence Similarity Networks and species level comparisons of great ape genomes to identify 45 new genes that have emerged by transcriptional readthrough, that is, transcription-derived gene fusion. For 35 of these putative gene fusions, we have been able to assess available RNAseq data to determine whether there are reads that map to each breakpoint. A total of 29 of the putative gene fusions had annotated transcripts (9/29 of which are human-specific). We carried out RT-qPCR in a range of human tissues (placenta, lung, liver, brain, and testes) and found that 23 of the putative gene fusion events were expressed in at least one tissue. Examining the available ribosome foot-printing data, we find evidence for translation of three of the fused genes in human. Finally, we find enrichment for transcription-derived gene fusions in regions of known segmental duplication in human. Together, our results implicate chromosomal structural variation brought about by segmental duplication with the emergence of novel transcripts and translated protein products.},

To determine changes in the AD brain that may mediate the transition into dementia, the gene expression of approximately 10,000 full-length genes was compared in mild/moderate dementia cases to non-demented controls that exhibited high AD pathology. Including this latter group distinguishes this work from previous studies in that it allows analysis of early cognitive loss. Compared to non-demented high-pathology controls, the hippocampus of AD cases with mild/moderate dementia had increased gene expression of the inflammatory molecule major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II, as assessed with microarray analysis. MHC II protein levels were also increased and inversely correlated with cognitive ability. Interestingly, the mild/moderate AD dementia cases also exhibited decreased number of T cells in the hippocampus and the cortex compared to controls. In conclusion, transition into AD dementia correlates with increased MHC II + microglia-mediated immunity and is paradoxically paralleled by a decrease in T cell number, suggesting immune dysfunction.},

abstract = {Integrating large-scale functional genomic data has significantly accelerated our understanding of gene functions. However, no algorithm has been developed to differentiate functions for isoforms of the same gene using high-throughput genomic data. This is because standard supervised learning requires 'ground-truth' functional annotations, which are lacking at the isoform level. To address this challenge, we developed a generic framework that interrogates public RNA-seq data at the transcript level to differentiate functions for alternatively spliced isoforms. For a specific function, our algorithm identifies the 'responsible' isoform(s) of a gene and generates classifying models at the isoform level instead of at the gene level. Through cross-validation, we demonstrated that our algorithm is effective in assigning functions to genes, especially the ones with multiple isoforms, and robust to gene expression levels and removal of homologous gene pairs. We identified genes in the mouse whose isoforms are predicted to have disparate functionalities and experimentally validated the 'responsible' isoforms using data from mammary tissue. With protein structure modeling and experimental evidence, we further validated the predicted isoform functional differences for the genes Cdkn2a and Anxa6. Our generic framework is the first to predict and differentiate functions for alternatively spliced isoforms, instead of genes, using genomic data. It is extendable to any base machine learner and other species with alternatively spliced isoforms, and shifts the current gene-centered function prediction to isoform-level predictions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Eksi et al.},

These results remained significant, albeit less so, after incorporating two additional ASD datasets. Among the genes identified, several are hit by multiple functional de novo mutations, with RAB2A and SETD1A showing the highest statistical significance in ASD and SCZ, respectively.

abstract = {Background: RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) allows an unbiased survey of the entire transcriptome in a high-throughput manner. A major application of RNA-Seq is to detect differential isoform expression across experimental conditions, which is of great biological interest due to its direct relevance to protein function and disease pathogenesis. Detection of differential isoform expression is challenging because of uncertainty in isoform expression estimation owing to ambiguous reads and variability in precision of the estimates across samples. It is desirable to have a method that can account for these issues and is flexible enough to allow adjustment for covariates. Results: In this paper, we present MetaDiff, a random-effects meta-regression model that naturally fits for the above purposes. Through extensive simulations and analysis of an RNA-Seq dataset on human heart failure, we show that the random-effects meta-regression approach is computationally fast, reliable, and can improve the power of differential expression analysis while controlling for false positives due to the effect of covariates or confounding variables. In contrast, several existing methods either fail to control false discovery rate or have reduced power in the presence of covariates or confounding variables. The source code, compiled JAR package and documentation of MetaDiff are freely available at https://github.com/jiach/MetaDiff. Conclusion: Our results indicate that random-effects meta-regression offers a flexible framework for differential expression analysis of isoforms, particularly when gene expression is influenced by other variables.},

We demonstrate the utility of this approach on reads generated by a PacBio RS instrument from phage, prokaryotic and eukaryotic whole genomes, including the previously unsequenced genome of the parrot Melopsittacus undulatus, as well as for RNA-Seq reads of the corn (Zea mays) transcriptome.

In practice, despite its promising concept of design, TACE has not yet proved to be as effective and potent as it was thought in theory. Among several challenging obstacles that have not been resolved is the heterogeneity of chemotherapeutic agents employed and the several variations in the application of the technique. This disparity hinders the conduct of systematic meta-analyses or the design of randomized trials that would demonstrate a clear survival benefit. Embolization without chemotherapy (transcatheter arterial embolization- TAE) has often been categorized as a form of chemoembolization. In this procedure, an embolizing agent (e.g. gelfoam, polyvinyl alcohol, acrylic copolymer gelatin particles) is administered intra-arterially via catheter with the goal of completely occluding the tumor feeding vessels. These agents may produce different effects on vasculature, resulting in permanent or transient occlusion, by acting at different levels in the arterial system. Despite the extensive research that is available on hepatic embolization, the precise effects of embolization on tumor cells remain largely unknown. In fact, recent data suggest that hypoxia, generated by arterial embolization, may activate several genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), leading to compensatory angiogenesis and tumor growth. A direct link among the degree of embolization, tumor hypoxia, and the stimulation of new blood vessels has been suggested in a number of studies. Kobayashi et al. found that blood levels of VEGF were markedly increased in patients who had been treated with embolization. VEGF may also help in predicting treatment response and monitoring disease course after chemoembolization. Moreover, recent research has shown that tumor ischemia and hypoxia may also provide a mechanism for resisting apoptosis. Further, hypoxia has been associated with metastasis and poor-outcomes via an unclear mechanism. The formation of early revascularization after proximal and temporary embolization induced with gelfoam has also been described. It seems that the earlier the revascularization of the tumor occurs, the more incomplete the necrosis will be. An occlusion of more peripheral vessels generates a nearly complete tumor necrosis and current trends in interventional oncology seem to favor distal occlusion. TACE was introduced in 1977 by Dr. Yamada R., who first exploited hepatocellular carcinoma's preferential blood supply from the hepatic artery to deliver anti-tumor therapy, without damaging the surrounding liver parenchyma. A decade later, the observation that the injection of ethiodized oil (lipiodol), an iodinated ester derived from poppy-seed oil, can be selectively up-taken and retained by primary HCC and hepatic metastases of colonic and neuroendocrine tumors led to the enclosure of this compound as a main ingredient of the injected chemotherapeutic cocktail. Moreover, lipiodol was also found to effectively engage the chemotherapeutic agents, leading concurrently to embolization and tumor necrosis. Theoretically, embolization of the feeding vessel causes ischemia of the tumor, and when combined with chemotherapy, results in tumor necrosis. Surprisingly, only 44{\%} of large treated lesions demonstrate extensive necrosis in pathology, leading to further exploration of the underlying mechanisms responsible for tumor necrosis. Recent studies have shown that tumor ischemia and hypoxia up-regulate several molecular factors, such as the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), thereby preventing cell apoptosis and stimulating tumor growth. These observations should be further tested in the clinical setting so as to demonstrate the role of possible interactions between hypoxia and the effect of embolization during chemoembolization.},

abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common adult motor neuron disease that affects {\~{}}2/100 000 individuals each year worldwide. Patients with ALS suffer from rapidly progressive degeneration of motor neurons ultimately leading to death. The major pathological features observed in post-mortem tissue from patients with ALS are motor neuron loss, cortical spinal tract degeneration, gliosis and cytoplasmic neuronal inclusions formed by TDP-43 or TAR DNA binding Protein with a molecular mass of 43 kDa, which are now recognized as the signature lesions of sporadic ALS. TDP-43 possesses two RNA binding domains (RBD) and a glycine-rich C terminus classifying it with other heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins known as 2XRBD-Gly proteins. A number of reports showed that a subset of patients with ALS possess mutations in the TDP-43 (TARDBP) gene. This further strengthens the hypotheses that gain of toxic function or loss of function in TDP-43 causes ALS. Currently, 29 different TARDBP missense mutations have been reported in 51 unrelated sporadic or familial ALS cases and two cases of ALS plus concomitant frontotemporal lobar degeneration with a remarkable concentration of mutations in the C-terminal glycine-rich domain of TDP-43. As these mutations will most certainly be an invaluable tool for the design and implementation of ALS animal and cell models, as well as serve as a platform for exploring the pathobiology of TDP-43, here we summarize the identified pathogenic TARDBP mutations and their potential impact on our understanding of the role of TDP-43 in disease. {\textcopyright} The Author 2009.

Building on recent studies supporting a role for developmentally regulated epigenetic variation in the molecular aetiology of schizophrenia, this study aimed to identify epigenetic variation associated with both a diagnosis of schizophrenia and elevated polygenic risk burden for the disease across multiple brain regions. Genome-wide DNA methylation was quantified in 262 post-mortem brain samples, representing tissue from four brain regions (prefrontal cortex, striatum, hippocampus and cerebellum) from 41 schizophrenia patients and 47 controls. We identified multiple disease-associated and polygenic risk score-associated differentially methylated positions and regions, which are not enriched in genomic regions identified in genetic studies of schizophrenia and do not reflect direct genetic effects on DNA methylation. Our study represents the first analysis of epigenetic variation associated with schizophrenia across multiple brain regions and highlights the utility of polygenic risk scores for identifying molecular pathways associated with aetiological variation in complex disease.},

abstract = {Despite the importance of duplicate genes for evolutionary adaptation, accurate gene annotation is often incomplete, incorrect, or lacking in regions of segmental duplication. We developed an approach combining long-read sequencing and hybridization capture to yield full-length transcript information and confidently distinguish between nearly identical genes/paralogs. We used biotinylated probes to enrich for full-length cDNA from duplicated regions, which were then amplified, size-fractionated, and sequenced using single-molecule, long-read sequencing technology, permitting us to distinguish between highly identical genes by virtue of multiple paralogous sequence variants. We examined 19 gene families as expressed in developing and adult human brain, selected for their high sequence identity (average {\textgreater}99{\%}) and overlap with human-specific segmental duplications (SDs).We characterized the transcriptional differences between related paralogs to better understand the birth-death process of duplicate genes and particularly how the process leads to gene innovation. In 48{\%} of the cases, we find that the expressed duplicates have changed substantially from their ancestral models due to novel sites of transcription initiation, splicing, and polyadenylation, as well as fusion transcripts that connect duplication-derived exons with neighboring genes. We detect unannotated open reading frames in genes currently annotated as pseudogenes, while relegating other duplicates to nonfunctional status. Our method significantly improves gene annotation, specifically defining full-length transcripts, isoforms, and open reading frames for new genes in highly identical SDs. The approach will be more broadly applicable to genes in structurally complex regions of other genomes where the duplication process creates novel genes important for adaptive traits.},

Using immunohistochemical procedures with two specific monoclonal antibodies to HLA-DR, HLA-DR-positive reactive microglia were found in gray matter throughout the cortex of postmortem brains of patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) and were particularly concentrated in the areas of senile plaque formation. Double immunostaining with antibodies to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) showed that the HLA-DR-positive cells were different from the reactive astrocytes although the occasional positively staining giant astrocyte was also seen. Small numbers of resting microglia were HLA-DR-positive in white matter of both normal and SDAT brains. The SDAT cases also had reduced cortical choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) levels. In the 11 brains studied, the number of hippocampal HLA-DR-positive cells was positively correlated with the numbers of plaques and negatively correlated with average cortical ChAT. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 75 genetic risk loci for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), however for a substantial portion of these loci the genetic variants or genes directly involved in AD risk remain to be found. A GWAS locus defined by the index SNP rs1476679 in ZCWPW1 is one of the largest AD loci as the association signal spans 56 potential risk genes. The three most compelling candidate genes in this locus are ZCWPW1, PILRA and PILRB , based on genetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic evidence. We performed amplicon-based target enrichment and next-generation sequencing of the exons, exon-intron boundaries, and UTRs of ZCWPW1, PILRA and PILRB on an Illumina MiSeq platform in 1048 Flanders-Belgian late-onset AD patients and 1037 matched healthy controls. Along with the single-marker association testing, the combined effect of Sanger-validated rare variants was evaluated in SKAT-O. No common variants ( n = 40) were associated with AD. We identified 20 validated deleterious rare variants (MAF {\textless} 1{\%}, CADD score ≥ 20), 14 of which in ZCWPW1 . This included 4 predicted loss-of-function (LoF) mutations that were exclusively found in patients ( P = 0.011). Haplotype sharing analysis revealed distant common ancestors for two LoF mutations. Single-molecule long-read Nanopore sequencing analysis unveiled that all LoF mutations are phased with the risk haplotype in the locus. Our results support the recent report for the role of ultra-rare LoF ZCWPW1 variants in AD and suggest a potential risk mechanism for AD through ZCWPW1 haploinsufficiency. {\#}{\#}{\#} Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. {\#}{\#}{\#} Funding Statement The research was funded in part by the Alzheimer Research Foundation (SAO-FRA), the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO), and the University of Antwerp Research Fund, Belgium.

abstract = {Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known to be caused by multiple factors, meanwhile the pathogenic mechanism and development of AD associate closely with genetic factors. Existing understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying AD remains incomplete. Methods: Gene expression data (GSE48350) derived from post-modern brain was extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were derived from hippocampus and entorhinal cortex regions between AD patients and healthy controls and detected via Morpheus. Functional enrichment analyses, including Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analyses of DEGs, were performed via Cytoscape and followed by the construction of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Hub proteins were screened using the criteria: nodes degree≥10 (for hippocampus tissues) and ≥ 8 (for entorhinal cortex tissues). Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) was used to filtrate the important clusters. University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) and the database of RNA-binding protein specificities (RBPDB) were employed to identify the RNA-binding proteins of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). Results: 251 {\&} 74 genes were identified as DEGs, which consisted of 56 {\&} 16 up-regulated genes and 195 {\&} 58 down-regulated genes in hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, respectively. Biological analyses demonstrated that the biological processes and pathways related to memory, transmembrane transport, synaptic transmission, neuron survival, drug metabolism, ion homeostasis and signal transduction were enriched in these genes. 11 genes were identified as hub genes in hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, and 3 hub genes were identified as the novel candidates involved in the pathology of AD. Furthermore, 3 lncRNAs were filtrated, whose binding proteins were closely associated with AD. Conclusions: Through GO enrichment analyses, pathway analyses and PPI analyses, we showed a comprehensive interpretation of the pathogenesis of AD at a systematic biology level, and 3 novel candidate genes and 3 lncRNAs were identified as novel and potential candidates participating in the pathology of AD. The results of this study could supply integrated insights for understanding the pathogenic mechanism underlying AD and potential novel therapeutic targets.},

Each alternative splicing event is controlled by multiple RBPs, the combined action of which creates a distribution of alternatively spliced products in a given cell type. As each cell type expresses a distinct array of RBPs, the interpretation of regulatory information on a given RNA target is exceedingly dependent on the cell type. RBPs also control each other's functions at many levels, including by mutual modulation of their binding activities on specific regulatory RNA elements.

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the toxicity of $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) on primary cortical and mesencephalic neurons cultured with and without microglia in order to determine the mechanism underlying microglia-mediated A$\beta$-induced neurotoxicity. Incubation of cortical or mesencephalic neuron-enriched and mixed neuron-glia cultures with A$\beta$(1-42) over the concentration range 0.1-6.0 $\mu$M caused concentration-dependent neurotoxicity. High concentrations of A$\beta$ (6.0 $\mu$M for cortex and 1.5-2.0 $\mu$M for mesencephalon) directly injured neurons in neuron-enriched cultures. In contrast, lower concentrations of A$\beta$ (1.0-3.0 $\mu$M for cortex and 0.25-1.0 $\mu$M for mesencephalon) caused significant neurotoxicity in mixed neuron-glia cultures, but not in neuron- enriched cultures. Several lines of evidence indicated that microglia mediated the potentiated neurotoxicity of A$\beta$, including the observations that low concentrations of A$\beta$ activated microglia morphologically in neuron-glia cultures and that addition of microglia to cortical neuron-glia cultures enhanced A$\beta$-induced neurotoxicity. To search for the mechanism underlying the microglia-mediated effects, several proinflammatory factors were examined in neuron-glia cultures. Low doses of A$\beta$ significantly increased the production of superoxide anions, but not of tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$, interleukin-1$\beta$ or nitric oxide. Catalase and superoxide dismutase significantly protected neurons from A$\beta$ toxicity in the presence of microglia. Inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity by diphenyleneiodonium also prevented A$\beta$-induced neurotoxicity in neuron-glia mixed cultures. The role of NADPH oxidase-generated superoxide in mediating A$\beta$-induced neurotoxicity was further substantiated by a study which showed that A$\beta$ caused less of a decrease in dopamine uptake in mesencephalic neuron-glia cultures from NADPH oxidase-deficient mutant mice than in that from wild-type controls. This study demonstrates that one of the mechanisms by which microglia can enhance the neurotoxicity of A$\beta$ is via the production of reactive oxygen species.},

AD is a multifactorial disorder, with the innate immune response and neuroinflammation at the forefront of the pathology. Thus, microglial cells along with peripheral circulating monocytes and more generally the innate immune response have been the target of several pre-clinical and clinical studies. More than a decade ago, inhibiting innate immune cells was considered to be the critical angle for preventing and treating brain diseases. After the failing of numerous clinical trials and the discovery that it may actually be the opposite in various pre-clinical models, the field has changed considerably. Here, we present both sides of the story with a particular emphasis on the beneficial properties of innate immune cells and how they can be targeted to have neuroprotective properties.},

abstract = {Obtaining high-quality sequence continuity of complex regions of recent segmental duplication remains one of the major challenges of finishing genome assemblies. In the human and mouse genomes, this was achieved by targeting large-insert clones using costly and laborious capillary-based sequencing approaches. Sanger shotgun sequencing of clone inserts, however, has now been largely abandoned, leaving most of these regions unresolved in newer genome assemblies generated primarily by next-generation sequencing hybrid approaches. Here we show that it is possible to resolve regions that are complex in a genome-wide context but simple in isolation for a fraction of the time and cost of traditional methods using long-read single molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing and assembly technology from Pacific Biosciences (PacBio). We sequenced and assembled BAC clones corresponding to a 1.3-Mbp complex region of chromosome 17q21.31, demonstrating 99.994{\%} identity to Sanger assemblies of the same clones. We targeted 44 differences using Illumina sequencing and find that PacBio and Sanger assemblies share a comparable number of validated variants, albeit with different sequence context biases. Finally, we targeted a poorly assembled 766-kbp duplicated region of the chimpanzee genome and resolved the structure and organization for a fraction of the cost and time of traditional finishing approaches. Our data suggest a straightforward path for upgrading genomes to a higher quality finished state.},

abstract = {Here we use deep sequencing to identify sources of variation in mRNA splicing in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of 450 subjects from two aging cohorts. Hundreds of aberrant pre-mRNA splicing events are reproducibly associated with Alzheimer's disease. We also generate a catalog of splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTL) effects: splicing of 3,006 genes is influenced by genetic variation. We report that altered splicing is the mechanism for the effects of the PICALM, CLU and PTK2B susceptibility alleles. Furthermore, we performed a transcriptome-wide association study and identified 21 genes with significant associations with Alzheimer's disease, many of which are found in known loci, whereas 8 are in novel loci. These results highlight the convergence of old and new genes associated with Alzheimer's disease in autophagy–lysosomal-related pathways. Overall, this study of the transcriptome of the aging brain provides evidence that dysregulation of mRNA splicing is a feature of Alzheimer's disease and is, in some cases, genetically driven.},

abstract = {The advent of next-generation sequencing technologies has revolutionized the study of genetic variation in the human genome. Whole-genome sequencing currently represents the most comprehensive strategy for variant detection genome-wide but is costly for large sample sizes, and variants detected in noncoding regions remain largely uninterpretable. By contrast, whole-exome sequencing has been widely applied in the identification of germline mutations underlying Mendelian disorders, somatic mutations in various cancers and de novo mutations in neurodevelopmental disorders. Since whole-exome sequencing focuses upon the entire set of exons in the genome (the exome), it requires additional exome-enrichment steps compared with whole-genome sequencing. Although the availability of multiple commercial exome-enrichment kits has made whole-exome sequencing technically feasible, it has also added to the overall cost. This has led to the emergence of transcriptome (or RNA) sequencing as a potential alternative approach to variant detection within protein coding regions, since the transcriptome of a given tissue represents a quasi-complete set of transcribed genes (mRNAs) and other noncoding RNAs. A further advantage of this approach is that it bypasses the need for exome enrichment. Here we discuss the relative merits and limitations of these approaches as they are applied in the context of variant detection within gene coding regions.},

In addition, we found 7881 novel splice junctions and 2301 differentially used alternative splicing events, enriched in genes involved in regulatory processes. We demonstrated experimentally cell-specific isoform usage, identifying nuclear factor I/B (NFIB) as a regulator of megakaryocyte maturation-the platelet precursor.

abstract = {Background: Based on amyloid cascade and tau hypotheses, protein biomarkers of different A$\beta$ and tau species in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood/plasma/serum have been examined to correlate with brain pathology. Recently, unbiased proteomic profiling of these human samples has been initiated to identify a large number of novel AD biomarker candidates, but it is challenging to define reliable candidates for subsequent large-scale validation. Methods: We present a comprehensive strategy to identify biomarker candidates of high confidence by integrating multiple proteomes in AD, including cortex, CSF and serum. The proteomes were analyzed by the multiplexed tandem-mass-tag (TMT) method, extensive liquid chromatography (LC) fractionation and high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) for ultra-deep coverage. A systems biology approach was used to prioritize the most promising AD signature proteins from all proteomic datasets. Finally, candidate biomarkers identified by the MS discovery were validated by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) and TOMAHAQ targeted MS assays. Results: We quantified 13,833, 5941, and 4826 proteins from human cortex, CSF and serum, respectively. Compared to other studies, we analyzed a total of 10 proteomic datasets, covering 17,541 proteins (13,216 genes) in 365 AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and control cases. Our ultra-deep CSF profiling of 20 cases uncovered the majority of previously reported AD biomarker candidates, most of which, however, displayed no statistical significance except SMOC1 and TGFB2. Interestingly, the AD CSF showed evident decrease of a large number of mitochondria proteins that were only detectable in our ultra-deep analysis. Further integration of 4 cortex and 4 CSF cohort proteomes highlighted 6 CSF biomarkers (SMOC1, C1QTNF5, OLFML3, SLIT2, SPON1, and GPNMB) that were consistently identified in at least 2 independent datasets. We also profiled CSF in the 5xFAD mouse model to validate amyloidosis-induced changes, and found consistent mitochondrial decreases (SOD2, PRDX3, ALDH6A1, ETFB, HADHA, and CYB5R3) in both human and mouse samples. In addition, comparison of cortex and serum led to an AD-correlated protein panel of CTHRC1, GFAP and OLFM3. In summary, 37 proteins emerged as potential AD signatures across cortex, CSF and serum, and strikingly, 59{\%} of these were mitochondria proteins, emphasizing mitochondrial dysfunction in AD. Selected biomarker candidates were further validated by ELISA and TOMAHAQ assays. Finally, we prioritized the most promising AD signature proteins including SMOC1, TAU, GFAP, SUCLG2, PRDX3, and NTN1 by integrating all proteomic datasets. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that novel AD biomarker candidates are identified and confirmed by proteomic studies of brain tissue and biofluids, providing a rich resource for large-scale biomarker validation for the AD community.},

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

abstract = {Ants are an emerging model system for neuroepigenetics, as embryos with virtually identical genomes develop into different adult castes that display diverse physiology, morphology, and behavior. Although a number of ant genomes have been sequenced to date, their draft quality is an obstacle to sophisticated analyses of epigenetic gene regulation. We reassembled de novo high-quality genomes for two ant species, Camponotus floridanus and Harpegnathos saltator. Using long reads enabled us to span large repetitive regions and improve genome contiguity, leading to comprehensive and accurate protein-coding annotations that facilitated the identification of a Gp-9-like gene as differentially expressed in Harpegnathos castes. The new assemblies also enabled us to annotate long non-coding RNAs in ants, revealing caste-, brain-, and developmental-stage-specific long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in Harpegnathos. These upgraded genomes, along with the new gene annotations, will aid future efforts to identify epigenetic mechanisms of phenotypic and behavioral plasticity in ants. Using long-read sequencing, Shields et al. upgrade the genome assemblies for two ant species. Their results reveal a protein-coding gene preferentially expressed in worker ants and genes for long non-coding RNAs, several of which were expressed in the brain, in some cases at different levels in workers and reproductives.},

Previous biological studies support roles of CLU and CR1 in the clearance of Β amyloid (AΒ) peptide, the principal constituent of amyloid plaques, which are one of the major brain lesions of individuals with Alzheimer's disease. {\textcopyright} 2009 Nature America, Inc.

abstract = {Epigenetics is being increasingly combined with epidemiology to add mechanistic understanding to associations observed between environmental, genetic and stochastic factors and human disease phenotypes. Currently, epigenetic epidemiological studies primarily focus on exploring if and where the epigenome (i.e. the overall epigenetic state of a cell) is influenced by specific environmental exposures like prenatal nutrition,1 sun exposure2 and smoking.3 In this issue of the IJE, Nada Borghol et al.4 report an association between childhood social-economic status (SES) and differential DNA methylation in adulthood. Low SES may integrate diverse and heterogeneous environmental influences, and knowing which epigenetic changes are associated with low SES may provide clues about the biological processes underlying its health consequences. The authors stress that their study is preliminary. This statement is, in fact, to a greater or lesser extent applicable to the entire first wave of studies currently being published that likewise aim to discover associations between epigenetic variation measured on a genome-wide scale and environmental exposures or disease phenotypes. When executing such epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs),5 every epigenetic epidemiologist is struggling with the same biological, technical and methodological issues. It is important to take these into consideration when designing a study and interpreting the results. Let us consider seven of those issues, taking the current study on SES as a starting point.},

abstract = {Background: Trans-splicing, the in vivo joining of two independently transcribed RNA molecules, is well characterized in lower eukaryotes, but was long thought absent from metazoans. However, recent bioinformatic analyses of EST sequences suggested widespread trans-splicing in mammals. These apparently spliced transcripts generally lacked canonical splice sites, leading us to question their authenticity. Particularly, the native ability of reverse transcriptase enzymes to template switch during transcription could produce apparently trans-spliced sequences. Principal Findings: Here we report an in vitro system for the analysis of template switching in reverse transcription. Using highly purified RNA substrates, we show the reproducible occurrence of apparent trans-splicing between two RNA molecules. Other reported non-canonical splicing events such as exon shuffling and sense-antisense fusions were also readily detected. The latter caused the production of apparent antisense non-coding RNAs, which are also reported to be abundant in humans. Conclusions: We propose that most reported examples of non-canonical splicing in metazoans arise through template switching by reverse transcriptase during cDNA preparation. We further show that the products of template switching can vary between reverse transcriptases, providing a simple diagnostic for identifying many of these experimental artifacts. {\textcopyright} 2010 Houseley, Tollervey.},

AS events detected in the brain are more highly conserved than those detected in other tissues, suggesting that they more often provide conserved functions. Our understanding of the mechanisms and functions of neural AS events has significantly advanced with the coupling of various computational and experimental approaches. These studies indicate that dynamic regulation of AS in the nervous system is critical for modulating protein-protein interactions, transcription networks, and multiple aspects of neuronal development. Furthermore, several underappreciated classes of AS with the aforementioned roles in neuronal cells have emerged from unbiased, global approaches. Collectively, these findings emphasize the importance of characterizing neural AS in order to gain new insight into pathways that may be altered in neurological diseases and disorders.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by accumulation of $\beta$-amyloid plaques (AP) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in the cortex, together with synaptic loss and amyloid angiopathy. Perturbations in the brain lysosomal system, including the cathepsin family of proteases, have been implicated in AD where they may be involved in proteolytic clearance of misfolded and abnormally aggregated peptides. However, the status of cathepsin D (catD) is unclear in Lewy body dementia, the second most common form of neurodegenerative dementia after AD, and characterized by Lewy bodies (LB) containing aggregated $\alpha$-synuclein. Furthermore, earlier reports of catD changes in AD have not been entirely consistent. We measured CatD immunoreactivities in the temporal (Brodmann area BA21) and parietal (BA40) cortices of well characterized AD brains as well as two clinical subtypes of Lewy body dementia, namely Parkinson disease dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), known to show varying degrees of concomitant AD pathology. Increased catD immunoreactivities in AD were found for both neocortical regions measured, where they also correlated with neuropathological NFT scores and phosphorylated pSer396 tau burden, and appeared to co-localize at least partly to NFT-containing neurons. In contrast, catD was increased only in BA40 in DLB and not at all in PDD, did not correlate with LB scores, and did not appreciably co-localize with $\alpha$-synuclein inclusions. Our study suggests that catD upregulation may be an adaptive response to AD-related processes leading to neurofibrillary degeneration, but may not be directly associated with formation of $\alpha$-synuclein inclusions in Lewy body dementia.},

AD research has, in large part, been dedicated to the understanding of A$\beta$ and NFT deposition as well as to the pharmacological reduction of these hallmarks. However, recent GWAS data indicates neuroinflammation plays a critical role in AD development, thereby redirecting research efforts toward unveiling the complexities of AD-associated neuroinflammation. It is clear that the innate immune system is intimately associated with AD progression, however, the specific roles of glia and neuroinflammation in AD pathology remain to be described. Moreover, inflammatory processes have largely been painted as detrimental to AD pathology, when in fact, many immune mechanisms such as phagocytosis aid in the reduction of AD pathologies. In this review, we aim to outline the delicate balance between the beneficial and detrimental aspects of immune activation in AD as a more thorough understanding of these processes is critical to development of effective therapeutics for AD.},

We examined the immunoreactivity of $\alpha$S in the SN, the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM), and the AC in 904 subjects with or without concomitant AD pathology. $\alpha$S-positive structures were seen in at least one of the studied brain areas in 121 subjects (13{\%}). The affected regions in the $\alpha$S-positive subjects included the SN (89{\%}), the nbM (73{\%}), and the AC (67{\%}). This study also included 82 sporadic AD patients diagnosed using CERAD criteria. $\alpha$S-positive structures were seen in 32{\%} of the AD patients, with the SN and AC being equally affected. In a few subjects the AC was the only affected area. However, this was not inevitably associated with AD pathology, but was related to cognitive decline.

Previously, we showed that AD risk alleles are enriched in myeloid-specific epigenomic annotations. Here, we show that they are specifically enriched in active enhancers of monocytes, macrophages and microglia. We integrated AD GWAS with myeloid epigenomic and transcriptomic datasets using analytical approaches to link myeloid enhancer activity to target gene expression regulation and AD risk modification. We identify AD risk enhancers and nominate candidate causal genes among their likely targets (including AP4E1, AP4M1, APBB3, BIN1, MS4A4A, MS4A6A, PILRA, RABEP1, SPI1, TP53INP1, and ZYX) in twenty loci. Fine-mapping of these enhancers nominates candidate functional variants that likely modify AD risk by regulating gene expression in myeloid cells. In the MS4A locus we identified a single candidate functional variant and validated it in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived microglia and brain. Taken together, this study integrates AD GWAS with multiple myeloid genomic datasets to investigate the mechanisms of AD risk alleles and nominates candidate functional variants, regulatory elements and genes that likely modulate disease susceptibility.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: RNA-Seq has become a key technology in transcriptome studies because it can quantify overall expression levels and the degree of alternative splicing for each gene simultaneously. To interpret high-throughout transcriptome profiling data, functional enrichment analysis is critical. However, existing functional analysis methods can only account for differential expression, leaving differential splicing out altogether. RESULTS: In this work, we present a novel approach to derive biological insight by integrating differential expression and splicing from RNA-Seq data with functional gene set analysis. This approach designated SeqGSEA, uses count data modelling with negative binomial distributions to first score differential expression and splicing in each gene, respectively, followed by two strategies to combine the two scores for integrated gene set enrichment analysis. Method comparison results and biological insight analysis on an artificial data set and three real RNA-Seq data sets indicate that our approach outperforms alternative analysis pipelines and can detect biological meaningful gene sets with high confidence, and that it has the ability to determine if transcription or splicing is their predominant regulatory mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: By integrating differential expression and splicing, the proposed method SeqGSEA is particularly useful for efficiently translating RNA-Seq data to biological discoveries.},

This discovery of large and 'hidden' transcriptome rejuvenates the demand for methods that can rapidly distinguish between coding and noncoding RNA. Here, we present a novel alignment-free method, Coding Potential Assessment Tool (CPAT), which rapidly recognizes coding and noncoding transcripts from a large pool of candidates. To this end, CPAT uses a logistic regression model built with four sequence features: open reading frame size, open reading frame coverage, Fickett TESTCODE statistic and hexamer usage bias. CPAT software outperformed (sensitivity: 0.96, specificity: 0.97) other state-of-the-art alignment-based software such as Coding-Potential Calculator (sensitivity: 0.99, specificity: 0.74) and Phylo Codon Substitution Frequencies (sensitivity: 0.90, specificity: 0.63). In addition to high accuracy, CPAT is approximately four orders of magnitude faster than Coding-Potential Calculator and Phylo Codon Substitution Frequencies, enabling its users to process thousands of transcripts within seconds. The software accepts input sequences in either FASTA- or BED-formatted data files.

abstract = {Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common causes of neurodegenerative disorder in the elderly individuals. Clinically, patients initially present with short-term memory loss, subsequently followed by executive dysfunction, confusion, agitation, and behavioral disturbances. Three causative genes have been associated with autosomal dominant familial AD (APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2) and 1 genetic risk factor (APOE$\mu$4 allele). Identification of these genes has led to a number of animal models that have been useful to study the pathogenesis underlying AD. In this article, we provide an overview of the clinical and genetic features of AD. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Alternative splicing (AS) is a post-transcriptional process that occurs in multiexon genes, and errors in this process have been implicated in many human diseases. Until recently, technological limitations prevented AS from being examined at the genome-wide scale. With the advent of new technologies, including exon arrays and next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques (e.g., RNA-Seq), a higher resolution view of the human transcriptome is now available. This is particularly applicable in the study of neurodegenerative brain diseases (NBDs), such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, because the brain has the greatest amount of alternative splicing of all human tissues. Although many of the AS events associated with these disorders were initially identified using low-throughput methodologies, genome-wide analysis allows for more in-depth studies, marking a new chapter in transcript exploration. In this review, the latest technologies used to study the transcriptome and the AS genes that have been associated with a number of neurodegenerative brain diseases are discussed.},

abstract = {Background: Gossypium australe F. Mueller (2n = 2x = 26, G2 genome) possesses valuable characteristics. For example, the delayed gland morphogenesis trait causes cottonseed protein and oil to be edible while retaining resistance to biotic stress. However, the lack of gene sequences and their alternative splicing (AS) in G. australe remain unclear, hindering to explore species-specific biological morphogenesis. Results: Here, we report the first sequencing of the full-length transcriptome of the Australian wild cotton species, G. australe, using Pacific Biosciences single-molecule long-read isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) from the pooled cDNA of ten tissues to identify transcript loci and splice isoforms. We reconstructed the G. australe full-length transcriptome and identified 25,246 genes, 86 pre-miRNAs and 1468 lncRNAs. Most genes (12,832, 50.83{\%}) exhibited two or more isoforms, suggesting a high degree of transcriptome complexity in G. australe. A total of 31,448 AS events in five major types were found among the 9944 gene loci. Among these five major types, intron retention was the most frequent, accounting for 68.85{\%} of AS events. 29,718 polyadenylation sites were detected from 14,536 genes, 7900 of which have alternative polyadenylation sites (APA). In addition, based on our AS events annotations, RNA-Seq short reads from germinating seeds showed that differential expression of these events occurred during seed germination. Ten AS events that were randomly selected were further confirmed by RT-PCR amplification in leaf and germinating seeds. Conclusions: The reconstructed gene sequences and their AS in G. australe would provide information for exploring beneficial characteristics in G. australe.},

abstract = {Objective. —To examine more closely the association between apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype and Alzheimer disease (AD) by age and sex in populations of various ethnic and racial denominations. Data Sources. —Forty research teams contributed data onAPOEgenotype, sex, age at disease onset, and ethnic background for 5930 patients who met criteria for probable or definite AD and 8607 controls without dementia who were recruited from clinical, community, and brain bank sources. Main Outcome Measures. —Odds ratios (ORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (Cls) for AD, adjusted for age and study and stratified by major ethnic group (Caucasian, African American, Hispanic, and Japanese) and source, were computed forAPOEgenotypes ∈2/∈2,∈2/∈3,∈2/∈4,∈3/∈4 and ∈4/∈4 relative to the ∈3/∈3 group. The influence of age and sex on the OR for each genotype was assessed using logistic regression procedures. Results. —Among Caucasian subjects from clinic- or autopsy-based studies, the risk of AD was significantly increased for people with genotypes ∈2/∈4 (OR=2.6, 95{\%} Cl=1.6-4.0), ∈3/∈4 (OR=3.2, 95{\%} Cl=2.8-3.8), and ∈4/∈4 (OR=14.9, 95{\%} CI=10.8-20.6); whereas, the ORs were decreased for people with genotypes ∈2/∈2 (OR=0.6, 95{\%} Cl=0.2-2.0) and ∈2/∈3 (OR=0.6, 95{\%} Cl=0.5-0.8). TheAPOE∈4-AD association was weaker among African Americans and Hispanics, but there was significant heterogeneity in ORs among studies of African Americans (P{\textless}.03). TheAPOE∈4—AD association in Japanese subjects was stronger than in Caucasian subjects (∈3/∈4: OR=5.6, 95{\%} Cl=3.9-8.0; ∈4/∈4: OR=33.1, 95{\%} Cl=13.6-80.5). The ∈2/∈3 genotype appears equally protective across ethnic groups. We also found that among Caucasians,APOEgenotype distributions are similar in groups of patients with AD whose diagnoses were determined clinically or by autopsy. In addition, we found that theAPOE∈4 effect is evident at all ages between 40 and 90 years but diminishes after age 70 years and that the risk of AD associated with a given genotype varies with sex. Conclusions. —TheAPOE∈4 allele represents a major risk factor for AD in all ethnic groups studied, across all ages between 40 and 90 years, and in both men and women. The association betweenAPOE∈4 and AD in African Americans requires clarification, and the attenuated effect ofAPOE∈4 in Hispanics should be investigated further.},

abstract = {Genetic studies have identified dozens of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) susceptibility genes, raising two critical questions: (1) do these genetic loci converge on specific biological processes, and (2) where does the phenotypic specificity of ASD arise, given its genetic overlap with intellectual disability (ID)? To address this, we mapped ASD and ID risk genes onto coexpression networks representing developmental trajectories and transcriptional profiles representing fetal and adult cortical laminae. ASD genes tightly coalesce in modules that implicate distinct biological functions during human cortical development, including early transcriptional regulation and synaptic development. Bioinformatic analyses suggest that translational regulation by FMRP and transcriptional coregulation by common transcription factors connect these processes. At a circuit level, ASD genes are enriched in superficial cortical layers and glutamatergic projection neurons. Furthermore, we show that the patterns of ASD and ID risk genes are distinct, providing a biological framework for further investigating the pathophysiology of ASD. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Genetic variations in the myeloid immune receptor TREM2 are linked to several neurodegenerative diseases. To determine how TREM2 variants contribute to these diseases, we performed structural and functional studies of wild-type and variant proteins. Our 3.1 {\AA} TREM2 crystal structure revealed that mutations found in Nasu-Hakola disease are buried whereas Alzheimer's disease risk variants are found on the surface, suggesting that these mutations have distinct effects on TREM2 function. Biophysical and cellular methods indicate that Nasu-Hakola mutations impact protein stability and decrease folded TREM2 surface expression, whereas Alzheimer's risk variants impact binding to a TREM2 ligand. Additionally, the Alzheimer's risk variants appear to epitope map a functional surface on TREM2 that is unique within the larger TREM family. These findings provide a guide to structural and functional differences among genetic variants of TREM2, indicating that therapies targeting the TREM2 pathway should be tailored to these genetic and functional differences with patient-specific medicine approaches for neurodegenerative disorders.},

abstract = {Determining the layers of gene regulation within the innate immune response is critical to our understanding of the cellular responses to infection and dysregulation in disease. We identified a conserved mechanism of gene regulation in human and mouse via changes in alternative first exon (AFE) usage following inflammation, resulting in changes to the isoforms produced. Of these AFE events, we identified 95 unannotated transcription start sites (TSS) in mice using a de novo transcriptome generated by long-read native RNA sequencing, one of which is in the cytosolic receptor for dsDNA and known inflammatory inducible gene, Aim2. We show that this unannotated AFE isoform of Aim2 is the predominant isoform expressed during inflammation and contains an iron-responsive element in its 5′UTR enabling mRNA translation to be regulated by iron levels. This work highlights the importance of examining alternative isoform changes and translational regulation in the innate immune response and uncovers novel regulatory mechanisms of Aim2. Summary Sentence: Alternative first exon usage was the major splicing event observed in macrophages during inflammation, which resulted in the elucidation of a novel isoform and iron mediated regulatory mechanism of the protein coding gene, Aim2.},

Many RNA-seq studies have used insufficient biological replicates, resulting in low statistical power and inefficient use of sequencing resources.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We show the explicit trade-off between more biological replicates and deeper sequencing in increasing power to detect differentially expressed (DE) genes. In the human cell line MCF7, adding more sequencing depth after 10 M reads gives diminishing returns on power to detect DE genes, whereas adding biological replicates improves power significantly regardless of sequencing depth. We also propose a cost-effectiveness metric for guiding the design of large-scale RNA-seq DE studies. Our analysis showed that sequencing less reads and performing more biological replication is an effective strategy to increase power and accuracy in large-scale differential expression RNA-seq studies, and provided new insights into efficient experiment design of RNA-seq studies.

In this combined positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) study, we aimed to investigate spatial associations between regional tau pathology ([18F]flortaucipir PET), synaptic density (synaptic vesicle 2A [11C]UCB-J PET) and synaptic function (MEG) in Alzheimer's disease. Methods: Seven amyloid-positive Alzheimer's disease subjects from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort underwent dynamic 130-min [18F]flortaucipir PET, dynamic 60-min [11C]UCB-J PET with arterial sampling and 2 × 5-min resting-state MEG measurement. [18F]flortaucipir- and [11C]UCB-J-specific binding (binding potential, BPND) and MEG spectral measures (relative delta, theta and alpha power; broadband power; and peak frequency) were assessed in cortical brain regions of interest. Associations between regional [18F]flortaucipir BPND, [11C]UCB-J BPND and MEG spectral measures were assessed using Spearman correlations and generalized estimating equation models. Results: Across subjects, higher regional [18F]flortaucipir uptake was associated with lower [11C]UCB-J uptake. Within subjects, the association between [11C]UCB-J and [18F]flortaucipir depended on within-subject neocortical tau load; negative associations were observed when neocortical tau load was high, gradually changing into opposite patterns with decreasing neocortical tau burden. Both higher [18F]flortaucipir and lower [11C]UCB-J uptake were associated with altered synaptic function, indicative of slowing of oscillatory activity, most pronounced in the occipital lobe. Conclusions: These results indicate that in Alzheimer's disease, tau pathology is closely associated with reduced synaptic density and synaptic dysfunction.},

abstract = {Full-length RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has been applied to bulk tissue, cell lines and sorted cells to characterize transcriptomes1–11, but applying this technology to single cells has proven to be difficult, with less than ten single-cell transcriptomes having been analyzed thus far12,13. Although single splicing events have been described for ≤200 single cells with statistical confidence14,15, full-length mRNA analyses for hundreds of cells have not been reported. Single-cell short-read 3′ sequencing enables the identification of cellular subtypes16–21, but full-length mRNA isoforms for these cell types cannot be profiled. We developed a method that starts with bulk tissue and identifies single-cell types and their full-length RNA isoforms without fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Using single-cell isoform RNA-Seq (ScISOr-Seq), we identified RNA isoforms in neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and cell subtypes such as Purkinje and Granule cells, and cell-type-specific combination patterns of distant splice sites6–9,22,23. We used ScISOr-Seq to improve genome annotation in mouse Gencode version 10 by determining the cell-type-specific expression of 18,173 known and 16,872 novel isoforms.},

Methods Genomic DNA was extracted from blood and postmortem brain samples, including the basal ganglia and cortex from both patients and from the cerebellum, midbrain, and pituitary gland from 1 patient. Repeat sizing was performed using fragment analysis, small-pool PCR-based Southern blotting, and Oxford nanopore sequencing. Results The basal ganglia ( p {\textless} 0.001) and cerebellum ( p {\textless} 0.001) showed higher median repeat numbers and higher degrees of repeat instability compared with blood. Conclusions Somatic repeat instability may predominate in brain regions selectively affected in XDP, thereby hinting at its potential role in disease manifestation and modification.

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is hypothesized to be caused by an imbalance between $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) production and clearance that leads to A$\beta$ accumulation in the central nervous system (CNS). A$\beta$ production and clearance are key targets in the development of disease-modifying therapeutic agents for Alzheimer's disease. However, there has not been direct evidence of altered A$\beta$ production or clearance in Alzheimer's disease. By using metabolic labeling, we measured A$\beta$42 and A$\beta$40 production and clearance rates in the CNS of participants with Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal controls. Clearance rates for both A$\beta$42 and A$\beta$40 were impaired in Alzheimer's disease compared with controls. On average, there were no differences in A$\beta$40 or A$\beta$42 production rates. Thus, the common late-onset form of Alzheimer's disease is characterized by an overall impairment in A$\beta$ clearance.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) is widely used by higher eukaryotes to generate different protein isoforms in specific cell or tissue types. To compare AS events across human tissues, we analyzed the splicing patterns of genomically aligned expressed sequence tags (ESTs) derived from libraries of cDNAs from different tissues. RESULTS: Controlling for differences in EST coverage among tissues, we found that the brain and testis had the highest levels of exon skipping. The most pronounced differences between tissues were seen for the frequencies of alternative 3' splice site and alternative 5' splice site usage, which were about 50 to 100{\%} higher in the liver than in any other human tissue studied. Quantifying differences in splice junction usage, the brain, pancreas, liver and the peripheral nervous system had the most distinctive patterns of AS. Analysis of available microarray expression data showed that the liver had the most divergent pattern of expression of serine-arginine protein and heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein genes compared to the other human tissues studied, possibly contributing to the unusually high frequency of alternative splice site usage seen in liver. Sequence motifs enriched in alternative exons in genes expressed in the brain, testis and liver suggest specific splicing factors that may be important in AS regulation in these tissues. CONCLUSIONS: This study distinguishes the human brain, testis and liver as having unusually high levels of AS, highlights differences in the types of AS occurring commonly in different tissues, and identifies candidate cis-regulatory elements and trans-acting factors likely to have important roles in tissue-specific AS in human cells.},

abstract = {Age is the most important risk factor for neurodegeneration; however, the effects of aging and neurodegeneration on gene expression in the human brain have most often been studied separately. Here, we analyzed changes in transcript levels and alternative splicing in the temporal cortex of individuals of different ages who were cognitively normal, affected by frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), or affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD). We identified age-related splicing changes in cognitively normal individuals and found that these were present also in 95{\%} of individuals with FTLD or AD, independent of their age. These changes were consistent with increased polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB)-dependent splicing activity. We also identified disease-specific splicing changes that were present in individuals with FTLD or AD, but not in cognitively normal individuals. These changes were consistent with the decreased neuro-oncological ventral antigen (NOVA)-dependent splicing regulation, and the decreased nuclear abundance of NOVA proteins. As expected, a dramatic down-regulation of neuronal genes was associated with disease, whereas a modest down-regulation of glial and neuronal genes was associated with aging. Whereas our data indicated that the age-related splicing changes are regulated independently of transcript-level changes, these two regulatory mechanisms affected expression of genes with similar functions, including metabolism and DNA repair. In conclusion, the alternative splicing changes identified in this study provide a new link between aging and neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is a pervasive neurodegenerative disorder, the molecular complexity of which remains poorly understood. Here, we analysed 80,660 single-nucleus transcriptomes from the prefrontal cortex of 48 individuals with varying degrees of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Across six major brain cell types, we identified transcriptionally distinct subpopulations, including those associated with pathology and characterized by regulators of myelination, inflammation, and neuron survival. The strongest disease-associated changes appeared early in pathological progression and were highly cell-type specific, whereas genes upregulated at late stages were common across cell types and primarily involved in the global stress response. Notably, we found that female cells were overrepresented in disease-associated subpopulations, and that transcriptional responses were substantially different between sexes in several cell types, including oligodendrocytes. Overall, myelination-related processes were recurrently perturbed in multiple cell types, suggesting that myelination has a key role in Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology.

abstract = {Titin is a giant vertebrate striated muscle protein with critical importance for myofibril elasticity and structural integrity. We show here that the complete sequence of the human titin gene contains 363 exons, which together code for 38 138 residues (4200 kDa). In its central I-band region, 47 novel PEVK exons were found, which contribute to titin's extensible spring properties. Additionally, 3 unique I-band titin exons were identified (named novex-1 to -3). Novex-3 functions as an alternative titin C-terminus. The novex-3 titin isoform is ≈700 kDa in size and spans from Z1-Z2 (titin's N-terminus) to novex-3 (C-terminal exon). Novex-3 titin specifically interacts with obscurin, a 721-kDa myofibrillar protein composed of 57 Ig/FN3 domains, followed by one IQ, SH3, DH, and a PH domain at its C-terminus. The obscurin domains Ig48/Ig49 bind to novex-3 titin and target to the Z-line region when expressed as a GFP fusion protein in live cardiac myocytes. Immunoelectron microscopy detected the C-terminal Ig48/Ig49 obscurin epitope near the Z-line edge. The distance from the Z-line varied with sarcomere length, suggesting that the novex-3 titin/obscurin complex forms an elastic Z-disc to I-band linking system. This system could link together calcium-dependent, SH3-, and GTPase-regulated signaling pathways in close proximity to the Z-disc, a structure increasingly implicated in the restructuring of sarcomeres during cardiomyopathies.},

To identify genetic variants that affect cortical structure, we conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis of brain magnetic resonance imaging data from 51,665 individuals. We analyzed the surface area and average thickness of the whole cortex and 34 regions with known functional specializations. We identified 199 significant loci and found significant enrichment for loci influencing total surface area within regulatory elements that are active during prenatal cortical development, supporting the radial unit hypothesis. Loci that affect regional surface area cluster near genes in Wnt signaling pathways, which influence progenitor expansion and areal identity. Variation in cortical structure is genetically correlated with cognitive function, Parkinson's disease, insomnia, depression, neuroticism, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.},

abstract = {Through alternative splicing, most human genes express multiple isoforms that often differ in function. To infer isoform regulation from high-throughput sequencing of cDNA fragments (RNA-seq), we developed the mixture-of-isoforms (MISO) model, a statistical model that estimates expression of alternatively spliced exons and isoforms and assesses confidence in these estimates. Incorporation of mRNA fragment length distribution in paired-end RNA-seq greatly improved estimation of alternative-splicing levels. MISO also detects differentially regulated exons or isoforms. Application of MISO implicated the RNA splicing factor hnRNP H1 in the regulation of alternative cleavage and polyadenylation, a role that was supported by UV cross-linking-immunoprecipitation sequencing (CLIP-seq) analysis in human cells. Our results provide a probabilistic framework for RNA-seq analysis, give functional insights into pre-mRNA processing and yield guidelines for the optimal design of RNA-seq experiments for studies of gene and isoform expression.},

abstract = {Mammalian DNA methylation is a critical epigenetic mechanism orchestrating gene expression networks in many biological processes. However, investigation of the functions of specific methylation events remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate that fusion of Tet1 or Dnmt3a with a catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) enables targeted DNA methylation editing. Targeting of the dCas9-Tet1 or -Dnmt3a fusion protein to methylated or unmethylated promoter sequences caused activation or silencing, respectively, of an endogenous reporter. Targeted demethylation of the BDNF promoter IV or the MyoD distal enhancer by dCas9-Tet1 induced BDNF expression in post-mitotic neurons or activated MyoD facilitating reprogramming of fibroblasts into myoblasts, respectively. Targeted de novo methylation of a CTCF loop anchor site by dCas9-Dnmt3a blocked CTCF binding and interfered with DNA looping, causing altered gene expression in the neighboring loop. Finally, we show that these tools can edit DNA methylation in mice, demonstrating their wide utility for functional studies of epigenetic regulation.},

abstract = {High-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) promises simultaneous transcript discovery and abundance estimation. However, this would require algorithms that are not restricted by prior gene annotations and that account for alternative transcription and splicing. Here we introduce such algorithms in an open-source software program called Cufflinks. To test Cufflinks, we sequenced and analyzed {\textgreater}430 million paired 75-bp RNA-Seq reads from a mouse myoblast cell line over a differentiation time series. We detected 13,692 known transcripts and 3,724 previously unannotated ones, 62{\%} of which are supported by independent expression data or by homologous genes in other species. Over the time series, 330 genes showed complete switches in the dominant transcription start site (TSS) or splice isoform, and we observed more subtle shifts in 1,304 other genes. These results suggest that Cufflinks can illuminate the substantial regulatory flexibility and complexity in even this well-studied model of muscle development and that it can improve transcriptome-based genome annotation.},

abstract = {The goal of this study was to investigate the specific patterns of memory breakdown in patients suffering from early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). Twenty EOAD patients, twenty LOAD patients, twenty matched younger controls, and twenty matched older controls participated in this study. All participants underwent a detailed neuropsychological assessment, an MRI scan, an FDG-PET scan, and AD patients had biomarkers as supporting evidence of both amylo{\"{i}}dopathy and neuronal injury. Results of the neuropsychological assessment showed that both EOAD and LOAD groups were impaired in the domains of memory, executive functions, language, praxis, and visuoconstructional abilities, when compared to their respective control groups. EOAD and LOAD groups, however, showed distinct patterns of memory impairment. Even though both groups were similarly affected on measures of episodic, short term and working memory, in contrast semantic memory was significantly more impaired in LOAD than in EOAD patients. The EOAD group was not more affected than the LOAD group in any memory domain. EOAD patients, however, showed significantly poorer performance in other cognitive domains including executive functions and visuoconstructional abilities. A more detailed analysis of the pattern of semantic memory performance among patient groups revealed that the LOAD was more profoundly impaired, in tasks of both spontaneous recall and semantic recognition. Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) analyses showed that impaired semantic performance in patients was associated with reduced gray matter volume in the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) region, while PET-FDG analyses revealed that poorer semantic performance was associated with greater hypometabolism in the left temporoparietal region, both areas reflecting key regions of the semantic network. Results of this study indicate that EOAD and LOAD patients present with distinct patterns of memory impairment, and that a genuine semantic impairment may represent one of the clinical hallmarks of LOAD.},

GeneBase 1.1 thus offers the opportunity to perform analyses of the main gene structure parameters also following the search for any set of genes with the desired characteristics, allowing unique functionalities not provided by the NCBI Gene itself. In order to show the potential of our tool for local parsing, structuring and dynamic summarizing of publicly available databases for data retrieval, analysis and testing of biological hypotheses, we provide as a sample application a revised set of statistics for human nuclear genes, gene transcripts and gene features. In contrast with previous estimations strongly underestimating the length of human genes, a 'mean' human protein-coding gene is 67 kbp long, has eleven 309 bp long exons and ten 6355 bp long introns. Median, mean and extreme values are provided for many other features offering an updated reference source for human genome studies, data useful to set parameters for bioinformatic tools and interesting clues to the biomedical meaning of the gene features themselves.},

abstract = {High-throughput next-generation sequencing is now entering its second decade. However, it was not until 2008 that the first report of sequencing the brain transcriptome appeared (Mortazavi, Williams, Mccue, Schaeffer, {\&} Wold, 2008). These authors compared short-read RNA-Seq data for mouse whole brain with microarray results for the same sample and noted both the advantages and disadvantages of the RNA-Seq approach. While RNA-Seq provided exon level resolution, the majority of the reads were provided by a small proportion of highly expressed genes and the data analysis was exceedingly complex. Over the past 6 years, there have been substantial improvements in both RNA-Seq technology and data analysis. This volume contains 11 chapters that detail various aspects of sequencing the brain transcriptome. Some of the chapters are very methods driven, while others focus on the use of RNA-Seq to study such diverse areas as development, schizophrenia, and drug abuse. This chapter briefly reviews the transition from microarrays to RNA-Seq as the preferred method for analyzing the brain transcriptome. Compared with microarrays, RNA-Seq has a greater dynamic range, detects both coding and noncoding RNAs, is superior for gene network construction, detects alternative spliced transcripts, and can be used to extract genotype information, e.g., nonsynonymous coding single nucleotide polymorphisms. RNA-Seq embraces the complexity of the brain transcriptome and provides a mechanism to understand the underlying regulatory code; the potential to inform the brain-behavior-disease relationships is substantial. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

In this type of experiments, the researcher is frequently interested in studying gene expression changes along time and in evaluating trend differences between the various experimental groups. The large amount of data, multiplicity of experimental conditions and the dynamic nature of the experiments poses great challenges to data analysis. Results: In this work, we propose a statistical procedure to identify genes that show different gene expression profiles across analytical groups in time-course experiments. The method is a two-regression step approach where the experimental groups are identified by dummy variables. The procedure first adjusts a global regression model with all the defined variables to identify differentially expressed genes, and in second a variable selection strategy is applied to study differences between groups and to find statistically significant different profiles. The methodology is illustrated on both a real and a simulated microarray dataset. {\textcopyright} 2006 Oxford University Press.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies of late-onset Alzheimer's disease risk have previously identified genes primarily expressed in microglia that form a transcriptional network. Using transgenic mouse models of amyloid deposition, we previously showed that many of the mouse orthologues of these risk genes are co-expressed and associated with amyloid pathology. In this new study, we generate an improved RNA-seq-derived network that is expressed in amyloid-responsive mouse microglia and we statistically compare this with gene-level variation in previous human Alzheimer's disease genome-wide association studies to predict at least four new risk genes for the disease (OAS1, LAPTM5, ITGAM/CD11b and LILRB4). Of the mouse orthologues of these genes Oas1a is likely to respond directly to amyloid at the transcriptional level, similarly to established risk gene Trem2, because the increase in Oas1a and Trem2 transcripts in response to amyloid deposition in transgenic mice is significantly higher than both the increase of the average microglial transcript and the increase in microglial number. In contrast, the mouse orthologues of LAPTM5, ITGAM/CD11b and LILRB4 (Laptm5, Itgam/CD11b and Lilra5) show increased transcripts in the presence of amyloid plaques similar in magnitude to the increase of the average microglial transcript and the increase in microglia number, except that Laptm5 and Lilra5 transcripts increase significantly quicker than the average microglial transcript as the plaque load becomes dense. This work suggests that genetic variability in the microglial response to amyloid deposition is a major determinant for Alzheimer's disease risk, and identification of these genes may help to predict the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. These findings also provide further insights into the mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease for potential drug discovery.},

We present the distribution of over 150 million single-nucleotide variants in the coding and noncoding genome. Each newly sequenced genome contributes an average of 8,579 novel variants. In addition, each genome carries on average 0.7 Mb of sequence that is not found in the main build of the hg38 reference genome.

abstract = {Introduction TREM2 is a lipid-sensing activating receptor on microglia known to be important for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but whether it plays a beneficial or detrimental role in disease pathogenesis is controversial. Methods We analyzed AD risk of TREM2 variants in the NIMH AD Genetics Initiative Study and AD Sequencing Project. We compared each variant's risk and functional impact by a reporter assay. Finally, we analyzed expression of TREM2 on human monocytes. Results We provide more evidence for increased AD risk associated with several TREM2 variants, and show that these variants decreased or markedly increased binding to TREM2 ligands. We identify HDL and LDL as novel TREM2 ligands. We also show that TREM2 expression in human monocytes is minimal compared to monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Discussion Our results suggest that TREM2 signaling helps protect against AD but can cause harm in excess, supporting the idea that proper TREM2 function is important to counteract disease progression.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that currently affects 36 million people worldwide with no effective treatment available. Development of AD follows a distinctive pattern in the brain and is poorly modelled in animals. Therefore, it is vital to widen the spatial scope of the study of AD and prioritise the study of human brains. Here we show that functionally distinct human brain regions display varying and region-specific changes in protein expression. These changes provide insights into the progression of disease, novel AD-related pathways, the presence of a gradient of protein expression change from less to more affected regions and a possibly protective protein expression profile in the cerebellum. This spatial proteomics analysis provides a framework which can underpin current research and open new avenues to enhance molecular understanding of AD pathophysiology, provide new targets for intervention and broaden the conceptual frameworks for future AD research.},

abstract = {Over the last few years, RNA-seq has been used to study alterations in alternative splicing related to several diseases. Bioinformatics workflows used to perform these studies can be divided into two groups, those finding changes in the absolute isoform expression and those studying differential splicing. Many computational methods for transcriptomics analysis have been developed, evaluated and compared; however, there are not enough reports of systematic and objective assessment of processing pipelines as a whole. Moreover, comparative studies have been performed considering separately the changes in absolute or relative isoform expression levels. Consequently, no consensus exists about the best practices and appropriate workflows to analyse alternative and differential splicing. To assist the adequate pipeline choice, we present here a benchmarking of nine commonly used workflows to detect differential isoform expression and splicing. We evaluated the workflows performance over three different experimental scenarios where changes in absolute and relative isoform expression occurred simultaneously. In addition, the effect of the number of isoforms per gene, and the magnitude of the expression change over pipeline performances were also evaluated. Our results suggest that workflow performance is influenced by the number of replicates per condition and the conditions heterogeneity. In general, workflows based on DESeq, DEXSeq, Limma and NOISeq performed well over a wide range of transcriptomics experiments. In particular, we suggest the use of workflows based on Limma when high precision is required, and DESeq2 and DEXseq pipelines to prioritize sensitivity. When several replicates per condition are available, NOISeq and Limma pipelines are indicated.},

Stratification according to age of onset of Alzheimer's disease showed that the relative risk decreased with increasing onset age. However, among patients with an onset of disease after 80 years, there were still significantly more subjects with one or more first degree relatives with dementia as compared to controls (relative risk 2.6; 95{\%} confidence interval 1.3-5.2). The relative risk of Alzheimer's disease was significantly lower in patients who had one first degree relative with dementia (relative risk 2.6; 95{\%} confidence interval 2.0-3.5) as compared to those who had two or more affected relatives (relative risk 7.5; 95{\%} confidence interval 3.3-16.7).

abstract = {The removal of non-coding sequences, introns, from the mRNA precursors is an essential step in eukaryotic gene expression. U12-type introns are a minor subgroup of introns, distinct from the major or U2-type introns. U12-type introns are present in most eukaryotes but only account for less than 0.5{\%} of all introns in any given genome. They are processed by a specific U12-dependent spliceosome, which is similar to, but distinct from, the major spliceosome. U12-type introns are spliced somewhat less efficiently than the major introns, and it is believed that this limits the expression of the genes containing such introns. Recent findings on the role of U12-dependent splicing in development and human disease have shown that it can also affect multiple cellular processes not directly related to the functions of the host genes of U12-type introns. At the same time, advances in understanding the regulation and phylogenetic distribution of the minor spliceosome are starting to shed light on how the U12-type introns and the minor spliceosome may have evolved. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

An age-, sex- and APOE based risk score and family history were used to select cases most likely to harbor novel AD risk variants and controls least likely to develop AD by age 85 years. We tested {\~{}}1.5 million single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 50,000 insertion-deletion polymorphisms (indels) for association to AD, using multiple models considering individual variants as well as gene-based tests aggregating rare, predicted functional, and loss of function variants. Sixteen single variants and 19 genes that met criteria for significant or suggestive associations after multiple-testing correction were evaluated for replication in four independent samples; three with whole exome sequencing (2,778 cases, 7,262 controls) and one with genome-wide genotyping imputed to the Haplotype Reference Consortium panel (9,343 cases, 11,527 controls). The top findings in the discovery sample were also followed-up in the ADSP whole-genome sequenced family-based dataset (197 members of 42 EA families and 501 members of 157 CH families). We identified novel and predicted functional genetic variants in genes previously associated with AD. We also detected associations in three novel genes: IGHG3 (p = 9.8 × 10−7), an immunoglobulin gene whose antibodies interact with $\beta$-amyloid, a long non-coding RNA AC099552.4 (p = 1.2 × 10−7), and a zinc-finger protein ZNF655 (gene-based p = 5.0 × 10−6).

abstract = {To better understand the role of alternative splicing, we conducted a large-scale analysis of reliable alternative isoforms of known human genes. Each isoform was classified according to its splice pattern and supporting evidence. We found that one-third of the alternative transcripts examined contain premature termination codons, and most persist even after rigorous filtering by multiple methods. These transcripts are apparent targets of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a surveillance mechanism that selectively degrades nonsense mRNAs. Several of these transcripts are from genes for which alternative splicing is known to regulate protein expression by generating alternate isoforms that are differentially subjected to NMD. We propose that regulated unproductive splicing and translation (RUST), through the coupling of alternative splicing and NMD, may be a pervasive, underappreciated means of regulating protein expression.},

abstract = {Single-molecule sequencing instruments can generate multikilobase sequences with the potential to greatly improve genome and transcriptome assembly. However, the error rates of single-molecule reads are high, which has limited their use thus far to resequencing bacteria. To address this limitation, we introduce a correction algorithm and assembly strategy that uses short, high-fidelity sequences to correct the error in single-molecule sequences. We demonstrate the utility of this approach on reads generated by a PacBio RS instrument from phage, prokaryotic and eukaryotic whole genomes, including the previously unsequenced genome of the parrot Melopsittacus undulatus, as well as for RNA-Seq reads of the corn (Zea mays) transcriptome. Our long-read correction achieves {\textgreater}99.9{\%} base-call accuracy, leading to substantially better assemblies than current sequencing strategies: in the best example, the median contig size was quintupled relative to high-coverage, second-generation assemblies. Greater gains are predicted if read lengths continue to increase, including the prospect of single-contig bacterial chromosome assembly.},
annote = {Approach for accurate de novo assembly

Paper introduces novel approach of aligning complementary high-fidelity short-reads to pacbio long raw reads to generate a more highly-accuracte consensus read whereby error rate is algorthmically managed (hyrbid termed "PBcR" (Pac-Bio Corrected Read)
(whilst accuracy of long-reads can be achieved alone with circular consensus sequence, paper argues this gives relatively shorter-reads owing to limited polyermase life, subsequently limiting potential of long-reads)

Implications of more accurate PBcR of higher quality de novo assemblies with fewer errors, greater alignment of reads to reference genome, enabling more accurate downstream analysis

Advantages of PBcrR vs PacBio 
- PBcRs further faciltates isoform identification with obvious demarcation of exons vs Pac-Bio long reads
- more PBcRs aligned to reference genome, and specifically at annotated transcripts, vs pacbio raw reads, highlighting greater utility of PBcRs for transcript structure annotation and validation

Advantages of PBcR vs Illumina 
- whilst PBcR receives less coverage vs Illumina, achieved similar number of N50 contigs (50X coverage - 50X high-identity sequence) with greater accuracy 

Discussion points 
Assumption of uniform long read coverage and error with PacBio?

De novo assembly superior to referenced genome particularly when understanding diseases with frequent large structural variations (Li, Y. et al. Structural variation in two human genomes mapped at single-nucleotide resolution by whole genome de novo assembly. Nat. Biotechnol. 29, 723–730 (2011))},

abstract = {Alois Alzheimer first pointed out that the disease which would later bear his name has a distinct and recognizable neuropathological substrate. Since then, much has been added to our understanding of the pathological lesions associated with the condition. The 2 primary cardinal lesions associated with Alzheimer's disease are the neurofibrillary tangle and the senile plaque. The neurofibrillary tangle consists of abnormal accumulations of abnormally phosphorylated tau within the perikaryal cytoplasm of certain neurons. The senile plaque consists of a central core of beta-amyloid, a 4-kD peptide, surrounded by abnormally configured neuronal processes or neurites. Other neuropathological lesions are encountered in cases of Alzheimer's disease, but the disease is defined and recognized by these 2 cardinal lesions. Other lesions include poorly understood changes such as granulovacuolar degeneration and eosinophilic rod-like bodies (Hirano bodies). The loss of synaptic components is a change that clearly has a significant impact on cognitive function and represents another important morphological alteration. It is important to recognize that distinguishing between Alzheimer's disease, especially in its early stages, and normal aging may be very difficult, particularly if one is examining the brains of patients who died at an advanced old age. It is also noted that instances of pure forms of Alzheimer's disease, in the absence of other coexistent brain disease processes, such as infarctions or Parkinson's disease-related lesions, are relatively uncommon, and this must be taken into account by researchers who employ postmortem brain tissues for research. {\textcopyright} 2010 Mount Sinai School of Medicine.},

abstract = {Genetic variation in CLU encoding clusterin has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) through replicated genome-wide studies, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Following earlier reports that tightly regulated CLU alternative transcripts have different functions, we tested CLU single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including those associated with AD for quantitative effects on individual alternative transcripts. In 190 temporal lobe samples without pathology we found that the risk allele of the AD associated SNP rs9331888 increases the relative abundance of transcript NM{\_}203339 (P=4.3×10(-12)). Using an independent set of 115 AD and control samples, we replicated this result (p=0.0014) and further observed that multiple CLU transcripts are at higher levels in AD compared to controls. The AD SNP rs9331888 is located in the first exon of NM{\_}203339 and therefore, it is a functional candidate for the observed effects. We tested this hypothesis by in vitro dual luciferase assays using SK-N-SH cells and mouse primary cortical neurons and found allelic effects on enhancer function, consistent with our results on post-mortem human brain. These results suggest a biological mechanism for the genetic association of CLU with AD risk and indicate that rs9331888 is one of the functional DNA variants underlying this association.},

abstract = {Background: Nanopore sequencing is a rapidly developing third-generation sequencing technology, which can generate long nucleotide reads of molecules within a portable device in real-time. Through detecting the change of ion currency signals during a DNA/RNA fragment's pass through a nanopore, genotypes are determined. Currently, the accuracy of nanopore basecalling has a higher error rate than the basecalling of short-read sequencing. Through utilizing deep neural networks, the-state-of-the art nanopore basecallers achieve basecalling accuracy in a range from 85{\%} to 95{\%}. Result: In this work, we proposed a novel basecalling approach from a perspective of instance segmentation. Different from previous approaches of doing typical sequence labeling, we formulated the basecalling problem as a multi-label segmentation task. Meanwhile, we proposed a refined U-net model which we call UR-net that can model sequential dependencies for a one-dimensional segmentation task. The experiment results show that the proposed basecaller URnano achieves competitive results on the in-species data, compared to the recently proposed CTC-featured basecallers. Conclusion: Our results show that formulating the basecalling problem as a one-dimensional segmentation task is a promising approach, which does basecalling and segmentation jointly.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is pathologically defined by accumulation of extracellular amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$). Approximately 25 mutations in $\beta$-amyloid precursor protein (APP) are pathogenic and cause autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease. To date, the mechanism underlying the effect of APP mutation on A$\beta$ generation is unclear. Therefore, investigating the mechanism of APP mutation on Alzheimer's disease may help understanding of disease pathogenesis. Thus, APP mutations (A673T, A673V, E682K, E693G, and E693Q) were transiently co-transfected into human embryonic kidney cells. Western blot assay was used to detect expression levels of APP, beta-secretase 1, and presenilin 1 in cells. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to determine A$\beta$ 1-40 and A$\beta$ 1-42 levels. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass chromatography was used to examine VVIAT, FLF, ITL, VIV, IAT, VIT, TVI, and VVIA peptide levels. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to measure APP and early endosome antigen 1 immunoreactivity. Our results show that the protective A673T mutation decreases A$\beta$ 42 /A$\beta$ 40 rate by downregulating IAT and upregulating VVIA levels. Pathogenic A673V, E682K, and E693Q mutations promote A$\beta$ 42 /A$\beta$ 40 rate by increasing levels of CTF99, A$\beta$ 42 , A$\beta$ 40 , and IAT, and decreasing VVIA levels. Pathogenic E693G mutation shows no significant change in A$\beta$ 42 /A$\beta$ 40 ratio because of inhibition of $\gamma$-secretase activity. APP mutations can change location from the cell surface to early endosomes. Our findings confirm that certain APP mutations accelerate A$\beta$ generation by affecting the long A$\beta$ cleavage pathway and increasing A$\beta$ 42/40 rate, thereby resulting in Alzheimer's disease.},

The overall function of alternative splicing is to increase the diversity of mRNAs expressed from the genome. Alternative splicing changes proteins encoded by mRNAs, which has profound functional effects. Experimental analysis of these protein isoforms showed that alternative splicing regulates binding between proteins, between proteins and nucleic acids as well as between proteins and membranes. Alternative splicing regulates the localization of proteins, their enzymatic properties and their interaction with ligands. In most cases, changes caused by individual splicing isoforms are small. However, cells typically coordinate numerous changes in 'splicing programs', which can have strong effects on cell proliferation, cell survival and properties of the nervous system. Due to its widespread usage and molecular versatility, alternative splicing emerges as a central element in gene regulation that interferes with almost every biological function analyzed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Identifying and characterizing alternative splicing (AS) enables our understanding of the biological role of transcript isoform diversity. This study describes the use of publicly available RNA-Seq data to identify and characterize the global diversity of AS isoforms in maize using the inbred lines B73 and Mo17, and a related species, sorghum. Identification and characterization of AS within maize tissues revealed that genes expressed in seed exhibit the largest differential AS relative to other tissues examined. Additionally, differences in AS between the two genotypes B73 and Mo17 are greatest within genes expressed in seed. We demonstrate that changes in the level of alternatively spliced transcripts (intron retention and exon skipping) do not solely reflect differences in total transcript abundance, and we present evidence that intron retention may act to fine-tune gene expression across seed development stages. Furthermore, we have identified temperature sensitive AS in maize and demonstrate that drought-induced changes in alternative splicing involve distinct sets of genes in reproductive and vegetative tissues. Examining our identified AS isoforms within B73 x Mo17 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) identified splicing QTL (sQTL). 43.3{\%} of cis-sQTL regulated junctions are actually identified as alternative spliced junctions in our analysis, while 10 Mb windows on each side of 48.2{\%} of trans-sQTLs overlap with splicing related genes. Using sorghum as an out-group enabled direct examination of loss or conservation of AS between homeologous genes representing the two subgenomes of maize. We identify several instances where AS isoforms that are conserved between one maize homeologue and its sorghum orthologue are absent from the second maize homeologue, suggesting that these AS isoforms may have been lost after the maize whole genome duplication event. This comprehensive analysis provides new insights into the complexity of AS in maize.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia is a debilitating psychiatric condition often associated with poor quality of life and decreased life expectancy. Lack of progress in improving treatment outcomes has been attributed to limited knowledge of the underlying biology, although large-scale genomic studies have begun to provide insights. We report a new genome-wide association study of schizophrenia (11,260 cases and 24,542 controls), and through meta-analysis with existing data we identify 50 novel associated loci and 145 loci in total. Through integrating genomic fine-mapping with brain expression and chromosome conformation data, we identify candidate causal genes within 33 loci. We also show for the first time that the common variant association signal is highly enriched among genes that are under strong selective pressures. These findings provide new insights into the biology and genetic architecture of schizophrenia, highlight the importance of mutation-intolerant genes and suggest a mechanism by which common risk variants persist in the population.},

Here we apply single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis to 124 individual cells from human preimplantation embryos and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) at different passages. The number of maternally expressed genes detected in our data set is 22,687, including 8,701 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which represents a significant increase from 9,735 maternal genes detected previously by cDNA microarray. We discovered 2,733 novel lncRNAs, many of which are expressed in specific developmental stages. To address the long-standing question whether gene expression signatures of human epiblast (EPI) and in vitro hESCs are the same, we found that EPI cells and primary hESC outgrowth have dramatically different transcriptomes, with 1,498 genes showing differential expression between them. This work provides a comprehensive framework of the transcriptome landscapes of human early embryos and hESCs.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in aging individuals. Yet, the pathophysiological processes involved in AD onset and progression are still poorly understood. Among numerous strategies, a comprehensive overview of gene expression alterations in the diseased brain could contribute for a better understanding of the AD pathology. In this work, we probed the differential expression of genes in different brain regions of healthy and AD adult subjects using data from three large transcriptomic studies: Mayo Clinic, Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB), and ROSMAP. Using a combination of differential expression of gene and isoform switch analyses, we provide a detailed landscape of gene expression alterations in the temporal and frontal lobes, harboring brain areas affected at early and late stages of the AD pathology, respectively. Next, we took advantage of an indirect approach to assign the complex gene expression changes revealed in bulk RNAseq to individual cell types/subtypes of the adult brain. This strategy allowed us to identify previously overlooked gene expression changes in the brain of AD patients. Among these alterations, we show isoform switches in the AD causal gene amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) and the risk gene bridging integrator 1 (BIN1), which could have important functional consequences in neuronal cells. Altogether, our work proposes a novel integrative strategy to analyze RNAseq data in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases based on both gene/transcript expression and regional/cell-type specificities.},

We report nanopore sequencing of full-length cDNA from CLL samples with and without SF3B1 mutation, as well as normal B cell samples, giving a total of 149 million pass reads. We present FLAIR (Full-Length Alternative Isoform analysis of RNA), a computational workflow to identify high-confidence transcripts, perform differential splicing event analysis, and differential isoform analysis. Using nanopore reads, we demonstrate differential 3' splice site changes associated with SF3B1 mutation, agreeing with previous studies. We also observe a strong downregulation of intron retention events associated with SF3B1 mutation. Full-length transcript analysis links multiple alternative splicing events together and allows for better estimates of the abundance of productive versus unproductive isoforms. Our work demonstrates the potential utility of nanopore sequencing for cancer and splicing research.},

A detailed analysis of messenger RNA (mRNA) isoforms transcribed from theANXA1 and EEF1A1 loci confirmed their distinct composition. The expression of proteins predictedfrom the transcriptome analysis was evaluated by mass spectrometry and validated previouslyunknown protein isoforms predicted e.g., for EEF1A1. These protein isoforms distinguished thelineage negative cell population from the lineage positive cell population. Finally, transcriptisoforms expressed from paralogous gene loci (e.g., CFD, GATA2, HLA-A, B, and C) alsodistinguished cell subpopulations but were only detectable by full-length RNA sequencing. Thus,qualitatively distinct transcript isoforms from individual genomic loci separate bone marrow cellsubpopulations indicating complex transcriptional regulation and protein isoform generationduring hematopoiesis.},

To overcome this limitation, we combined targeted capture and long-read sequencing of T-cell-receptor (TCR) and B-cell-receptor (BCR) mRNA transcripts with short-read transcriptome profiling of barcoded single-cell libraries generated by droplet-based partitioning. We show that Repertoire and Gene Expression by Sequencing (RAGE-Seq) can generate accurate full-length antigen receptor sequences at nucleotide resolution, infer B-cell clonal evolution and identify alternatively spliced BCR transcripts. We apply RAGE-Seq to 7138 cells sampled from the primary tumor and draining lymph node of a breast cancer patient to track transcriptome profiles of expanded lymphocyte clones across tissues. Our results demonstrate that RAGE-Seq is a powerful method for tracking the clonal evolution from large numbers of lymphocytes applicable to the study of immunity, autoimmunity and cancer.},

abstract = {Understanding transcriptome complexity is crucial for understanding human biology and disease. Technologies such as Synthetic long-read RNA sequencing (SLR-RNA-seq) delivered 5 million isoforms and allowed assessing splicing coordination. Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore increase throughput also but require high input amounts or amplification. Our new droplet-based method, sparse isoform sequencing (spISO-seq), sequences 100k-200k partitions of 10-200 molecules at a time, enabling analysis of 10-100 million RNA molecules. SpISO-seq requires less than 1 ng of input cDNA, limiting or removing the need for prior amplification with its associated biases. Adjusting the number of reads devoted to each molecule reduces sequencing lanes and cost, with little loss in detection power. The increased number of molecules expands our understanding of isoform complexity. In addition to confirming our previously published cases of splicing coordination (e.g., BIN1), the greater depth reveals many new cases, such as MAPT. Coordination of internal exons is found to be extensive among protein coding genes: 23.5{\%}-59.3{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval) of highly expressed genes with distant alternative exons exhibit coordination, showcasing the need for long-read transcriptomics. However, coordination is less frequent for noncoding sequences, suggesting a larger role of splicing coordination in shaping proteins. Groups of genes with coordination are involved in protein-protein interactions with each other, raising the possibility that coordination facilitates complex formation and/or function. We also find new splicing coordination types, involving initial and terminal exons. Our results provide a more comprehensive understanding of the human transcriptome and a general, cost-effective method to analyze it.},

Here we have identified two Tangier disease (TD) families, confirmed 9q31 linkage and refined the disease locus to a limited genomic region containing the gene encoding the ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC1). Familial HDL deficiency (FHA) is a more frequent cause of low HDL levels. On the basis of independent linkage and meiotic recombinants, we localized the FHA locus to the same genomic region as the TD locus. Mutations in ABC1 were detected in both TD and FHA, indicating that TD and FHA are allelic. This indicates that the protein encoded by ABC1 is a key gatekeeper influencing intracellular cholesterol transport, hence we have named it cholesterol efflux regulatory protein (CERP).},

abstract = {The availability of human genome sequence has transformed biomedical research over the past decade. However, an equivalent map for the human proteome with direct measurements of proteins and peptides does not exist yet. Here we present a draft map of the human proteome using high-resolution Fourier-transform mass spectrometry. In-depth proteomic profiling of 30 histologically normal human samples, including 17 adult tissues, 7 fetal tissues and 6 purified primary haematopoietic cells, resulted in identification of proteins encoded by 17,294 genes accounting for approximately 84{\%} of the total annotated protein-coding genes in humans. A unique and comprehensive strategy for proteogenomic analysis enabled us to discover a number of novel protein-coding regions, which includes translated pseudogenes, non-coding RNAs and upstream open reading frames. This large human proteome catalogue (available as an interactive web-based resource at http://www.humanproteomemap.org) will complement available human genome and transcriptome data to accelerate biomedical research in health and disease. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {Although amyloid $\beta$ (A$\beta$) oligomers are presumed to cause synaptic and cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD), their contribution to other pathological features of AD remains unclear. To address the latter, we generated APP transgenic mice expressing the E693$\Delta$ mutation, which causes AD by enhanced A$\beta$ oligomerization without fibrillization. The mice displayed age-dependent accumulation of intraneuronal A$\beta$ oligomers from 8 months but no extracellular amyloid deposits even at 24 months. Hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory were impaired at 8 months, at which time the presynaptic marker synaptophysin began to decrease. Furthermore, we detected abnormal tau phosphorylation from 8 months, microglial activation from 12 months, astrocyte activation from 18 months, and neuronal loss at 24 months. These findings suggest that A$\beta$ oligomers cause not only synaptic alteration but also other features of AD pathology and that these mice are a useful model of A$\beta$ oligomer-induced pathology in the absence of amyloid plaques.

abstract = {We determined the effect on splicing of 24 point mutations in the 5′ and 3′ splice region of the large rabbit $\beta$-globin intron. In vitro, 3′ AG mutations drastically reduce 5′ cleavage and abolish splicing. In vivo, the same mutations elicit efficient splicing at a cryptic, rather than the correct, 3′ splice site. In vitro, mutations at all but 2 positions of the consensus 5′ splice region impair correct splicing and promote joining of exon 1 to exon 3. In vivo, the same mutations show no effect, except for those converting 5′ GT to AT or GA, which cause accumulation of lariat intermediate in vitro and in vivo. We conclude that the 5′ GT need not be conserved for 5′ cleavage and that it plays an important role in cleavage and exon joining at the 3′ splice site. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

abstract = {The development of insoluble, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of the microtubule-associated protein tau is a defining feature of tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Accumulating evidence suggests that tau pathology co-localizes with RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that are known markers for stress granules (SGs). Here we used proteomics to determine how the network of tau binding proteins changes with disease in the rTg4510 mouse, and then followed up with immunohistochemistry to identify RNA binding proteins that co-localize with tau pathology. The tau interactome networks revealed striking disease-related changes in interactions between tau and a multiple RBPs, and biochemical fractionation studies demonstrated that many of these proteins including hnRNPA0, EWSR1, PABP and RPL7 form insoluble aggregates as tau pathology develops. Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse and human brain tissues suggest a model of evolving pathological interaction, in which RBPs co-localize with pathological phospho-tau but occur adjacent to larger pathological tau inclusions. We suggest a model in which tau initially interacts with RBPs in small complexes, but evolves into isolated aggregated inclusions as tau pathology matures.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Alternative splicing of ErbB4 transcripts is dysregulated in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia. ErbB4 regulates the activity of parvalbumin interneurons, and therefore dysregulated ErbB4 splicing could contribute to lower parvalbumin interneuron activity and consequently lower parvalbumin levels in schizophrenia. However, ErbB4 is also present in calretinin interneurons, which are not affected in schizophrenia. Therefore, the authors hypothesized that dysregulated ErbB4 splicing occurs selectively in parvalbumin interneurons and is associated with lower parvalbumin levels in schizophrenia.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD: Tissue samples enriched in calretinin and parvalbumin interneurons were laser microdissected from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex layers 2 and 4, respectively, from matched pairs of schizophrenia and comparison subjects. Transcript levels for pan-ErbB4, four ErbB4 splicing variants (JM-a, JM-b, CYT-1, CYT-2), parvalbumin, and calretinin were quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in each layer. Transcript levels for myocardial infarction associated transcript (MIAT), which regulates ErbB4 splicing, were quantified in gray matter by qPCR and in parvalbumin interneurons by microarray.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Calretinin and parvalbumin mRNAs were preferentially expressed in layers 2 and 4, respectively. In schizophrenia subjects, lower parvalbumin levels, higher CYT-1 and JM-a levels, and lower CYT-2 and JM-b levels were detected selectively in layer 4. In layer 4, the JM-a/JM-b ratio was inversely correlated with parvalbumin levels in schizophrenia subjects. MIAT levels were preferentially higher in parvalbumin interneurons in schizophrenia subjects.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that elevated MIAT expression alters ErbB4 splicing selectively in parvalbumin interneurons in schizophrenia. Dysregulated ErbB4 splicing in schizophrenia may contribute to lower activity of parvalbumin interneurons and an activity-dependent down-regulation of parvalbumin expression.},

We performed a cross-tissue analysis of methylomic variation in AD using samples from four independent human post-mortem brain cohorts. We identified a differentially methylated region in the ankyrin 1 (ANK1) gene that was associated with neuropathology in the entorhinal cortex, a primary site of AD manifestation. This region was confirmed as being substantially hypermethylated in two other cortical regions (superior temporal gyrus and prefrontal cortex), but not in the cerebellum, a region largely protected from neurodegeneration in AD, or whole blood obtained pre-mortem from the same individuals. Neuropathology-associated ANK1 hypermethylation was subsequently confirmed in cortical samples from three independent brain cohorts.

abstract = {ABSTRACT Background. Sugarcane is an important global food crop and energy resource. To facilitate the sugarcane improvement program, genome and gene information are important for studying traits at the molecular level. Most currently available transcriptome data for sugarcane were generated using second-generation sequencing platforms, which provide short reads. The de novo assembled transcripts from these data are limited in length, and hence may be incomplete and inaccurate, especially for long RNAs. Methods. We generated a transcriptome dataset of leaf tissue from a commercial Thai sugarcane cultivar Khon Kaen 3 (KK3) using PacBio RS II single-molecule long-read sequencing by the Iso-Seq method. Short-read RNA-Seq data were generated from the same RNA sample using the Ion Proton platform for reducing base calling errors. Results. A total of 119,339 error-corrected transcripts were generated with the N50 length of 3,611 bp, which is on average longer than any previously reported sugarcane transcriptome dataset. 110,253 sequences (92.4{\%}) contain an open reading frame (ORF) of at least 300 bp long with ORF N50 of 1,416 bp. The mean lengths of 5? and 3? untranslated regions in 73,795 sequences with complete ORFs are 1,249 and 1,187 bp, respectively. 4,774 transcripts are putatively novel full-length transcripts which do not match with a previous Iso-Seq study of sugarcane. We annotated the functions of 68,962 putative full-length transcripts with at least 90{\%} coverage when compared with homologous protein coding sequences in other plants. Discussion. The new catalog of transcripts will be useful for genome annotation, identification of splicing variants, SNP identification, and other research pertaining to the sugarcane improvement program. The putatively novel transcripts suggest unique features of KK3, although more data from different tissues and stages of development are needed to establish a reference transcriptome of this cultivar.},

abstract = {Background RNA sequencing has been proposed as a means of increasing diagnostic rates in studies of undiagnosed rare inherited disease. Recent studies have reported diagnostic improvements in the range of 7.5–35{\%} by profiling splicing, gene expression quantification and allele specific expression. To-date however, no study has systematically assessed the presence of gene-fusion transcripts in cases of germline disease. Fusion transcripts are routinely identified in cancer studies and are increasingly recognized as having diagnostic, prognostic or therapeutic relevance. Isolated reports exist of fusion transcripts being detected in cases of developmental and neurological phenotypes, and thus, systematic application of fusion detection to germline conditions may further increase diagnostic rates. However, current fusion detection methods are unsuited to the investigation of germline disease due to performance biases arising from their development using tumor, cell-line or in-silico data. Methods We describe a tailored approach to fusion candidate identification and prioritization in a cohort of 47 undiagnosed, suspected inherited disease patients. We modify an existing fusion transcript detection algorithm by eliminating its cell line-derived filtering steps, and instead, prioritize candidates using a custom workflow that integrates genomic and transcriptomic sequence alignment, biological and technical annotations, customized categorization logic, and phenotypic prioritization. Results We demonstrate that our approach to fusion transcript identification and prioritization detects genuine fusion events excluded by standard analyses and efficiently removes phenotypically unimportant candidates and false positive events, resulting in a reduced candidate list enriched for events with potential phenotypic relevance. We describe the successful genetic resolution of two previously undiagnosed disease cases through the detection of pathogenic fusion transcripts. Furthermore, we report the experimental validation of five additional cases of fusion transcripts with potential phenotypic relevance. Conclusions The approach we describe can be implemented to enable the detection of phenotypically relevant fusion transcripts in studies of rare inherited disease. Fusion transcript detection has the potential to increase diagnostic rates in rare inherited disease and should be included in RNA-based analytical pipelines aimed at genetic diagnosis.},

abstract = {Personal transcriptomes in which all of an individual's genetic variants (e.g., single nucleotide variants) and transcript isoforms (transcription start sites, splice sites, and polyA sites) are defined and quantified for full-length transcripts are expected to be important for understanding individual biology and disease, but have not been described previously. To obtain such transcriptomes, we sequenced the lymphoblastoid transcriptomes of three family members (GM12878 and the parents GM12891 and GM12892) by using a Pacific Biosciences long-read approach complemented with Illumina 101-bp sequencing and made the following observations. First, we found that reads representing all splice sites of a transcript are evident for most sufficiently expressed genes ≤3 kb and often for genes longer than that. Second, we added and quantified previously unidentified splicing isoforms to an existing annotation, thus creating the first personalized annotation to our knowledge. Third, we determined SNVs in a de novo manner and connected them to RNA haplotypes, including HLA haplotypes, thereby assigning single full-length RNA molecules to their transcribed allele, and demonstrated Mendelian inheritance of RNA molecules. Fourth, we show how RNA molecules can be linked to personal variants on a one-by-one basis, which allows us to assess differential allelic expression (DAE) and differential allelic isoforms (DAI) from the phased full-length isoform reads. The DAI method is largely independent of the distance between exon and SNV-in contrast to fragmentation-based methods. Overall, in addition to improving eukaryotic transcriptome annotation, these results describe, to our knowledge, the first large-scale and full-length personal transcriptome.},

abstract = {We have analyzed the pathway of mammalian spliceosome assembly in vitro using a mobility retardation assay. The binding of splicing complexes to both wild-type and mutant beta-globin pre-RNAs was studied. Three kinetically related, ATP-dependent complexes, alpha, beta, and gamma, were resolved with a wild-type beta-globin substrate. These complexes formed, both temporally and in order of decreasing mobility, alpha----beta----gamma. All three complexes contained U2 snRNA. The RNA intermediates of splicing, i.e., free 5' exon and intron lariat + 3' exon, were found predominantly in the gamma complex. The RNA products of splicing, i.e., ligated exons and fully excised intron lariat, were found in separate, postsplicing complexes which appeared to form via breakdown of gamma. Mutations of the 5' splice site, which caused an accumulation of splicing intermediates, also resulted in accumulation of the gamma complex. Mutations of the 3' splice site, which severely inhibited splicing, reduced the efficiency and altered the pattern of complex formation. Surprisingly, the analysis of double mutants, with sequence alterations at both the 5' and 3' splice sites, revealed that the 5' splice site genotype was important for the efficient formation of a U2 snRNA-containing alpha complex at the 3' splice site. Thus, it appears that a collaborative interaction between the separate 5' and 3' splice sites promotes spliceosome assembly.},

Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD, n = 120) and early-onset frontotemporal dementia (EOFTD, n = 82) were studied. RESULTS The majority of participants, 72.5{\%} with EOAD and 74.4{\%} with EOFTD, did not have a positive family history of dementia. An autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance was observed in 14.2{\%} of patients with EOAD and 13.4{\%} of patients with FTD. Of those with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, 11.8{\%} of EOAD and 45.5{\%} of FTD probands had known pathogenic mutations. Only 1.6{\%} of the total population of EOAD and 7.3{\%} of EOFTD possessed known gene mutations. CONCLUSION Early-onset dementia does not appear to be a strongly inherited autosomal dominant condition. The majority of patients were sporadic. Known mutations were uncommon and do not explain the total autosomal dominant burden.},

abstract = {Allele-specific expression (ASE) is a fundamental problem in studying gene regulation and diploid transcriptome profiles, with two key challenges: (i) haplotyping and (ii) estimation of ASE at the gene isoform level. Existing ASE analysis methods are limited by a dependence on haplotyping from laborious experiments or extra genome/family trio data. In addition, there is a lack of methods for gene isoform level ASE analysis. We developed a tool, IDP-ASE, for full ASE analysis. By innovative integration of Third Generation Sequencing (TGS) long reads with Second Generation Sequencing (SGS) short reads, the accuracy of haplotyping and ASE quantification at the gene and gene isoform level was greatly improved as demonstrated by the gold standard data GM12878 data and semi-simulation data. In addition to methodology development, applications of IDPASE to human embryonic stem cells and breast cancer cells indicate that the imbalance of ASE and nonuniformity of gene isoform ASE is widespread, including tumorigenesis relevant genes and pluripotencymarkers. These results show that gene isoform expression and allele-specific expression cooperate to provide high diversity and complexity of gene regulation and expression, highlighting the importance of studying ASE at the gene isoform level. Our study provides a robust bioinformatics solution to understand ASE using RNA sequencing data only.},

abstract = {The underlying genetic variations of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) cases remain largely unknown. A combination of genetic variations with variable penetrance and lifetime epigenetic factors may converge on transcriptomic alterations that drive LOAD pathological process. Transcriptome profiling using deep sequencing technology offers insight into common altered pathways regardless of underpinning genetic or epigenetic factors and thus represents an ideal tool to investigate molecular mechanisms related to the pathophysiology of LOAD. We performed directional RNA sequencing on high quality RNA samples extracted from hippocampi of LOAD and age-matched controls. We further validated our data using qRT-PCR on a larger set of postmortem brain tissues, confirming downregulation of the gene encoding substance P (TAC1) and upregulation of the gene encoding the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (SERPINE1). Pathway analysis indicates dysregulation in neural communication, cerebral vasculature, and amyloid-$\beta$ clearance. Beside protein coding genes, we identified several annotated and non-annotated long noncoding RNAs that are differentially expressed in LOAD brain tissues, three of them are activity-dependent regulated and one is induced by A$\beta$(1-42) exposure of human neural cells. Our data provide a comprehensive list of transcriptomics alterations in LOAD hippocampi and warrant holistic approach including both coding and non-coding RNAs in functional studies aimed to understand the pathophysiology of LOAD.},

@article{Clinton2003,
abstract = {Objective: NMDA receptor dysfunction has been implicated in the pathophysiol-ogy of schizophrenia. The NMDA receptor is a multimeric ligand-gated ion channel, and the obligate NR 1 subunit is expressed as one of eight isoforms due to the alter-native splicing of exons 5, 21, and 22. Al-ternative splicing of NR 1 subunits modu-lates receptor function by influencing the association of NR 1 with other NMDA re-ceptor subunits and myriad intracellular molecules, such as the postsynaptic den-sity family of proteins that target NMDA receptors to the synaptic membrane and couple it to numerous signal transduction enzymes. Recently, the authors reported that the NMDA receptor subunits NR 1 and NR 2C are abnormally expressed in the thalamus in schizophrenia. They hypoth-esized that this reduction is associated with specific NR 1 isoforms and that NMDA receptor-related postsynaptic density pro-teins are abnormally expressed. Method: Using in situ hybridization, the authors examined expression of the tran-scripts encoding NR 1 isoforms containing exons 5, 21, or 22, and the NMDA recep-tor-related postsynaptic density proteins NF-L, PSD93, PSD95, and SAP102. Results: Reduced NR 1 subunit transcript expression was restricted to exon 22-con-taining isoforms. Increased expression of the NMDA receptor-associated postsynap-tic density proteins NF-L, PSD95, and SAP102 was also detected in the thalamus of subjects with schizophrenia. Conclusions: These data support the hy-pothesis of glutamatergic abnormalities in schizophrenia and suggest that gluta-matergic dysfunction may occur not only at the level of receptor expression but also within intracellular pathways associ-ated with glutamate receptor-associated signal transduction.},

abstract = {The focus on amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles has yielded no Alzheimer's disease (AD) modifying treatments in the past several decades, despite successful studies in preclinical mouse models. This inconsistency has caused a renewed focus on improving the fidelity and reliability of AD mouse models, with disparate views on how this improvement can be accomplished. However, the interactive effects of the universal biological variables of AD, which include age, APOE genotype, and sex, are often overlooked. Age is the greatest risk factor for AD, while the $\epsilon$4 allele of the human APOE gene, encoding apolipoprotein E, is the greatest genetic risk factor. Sex is the final universal biological variable of AD, as females develop AD at almost twice the rate of males and, importantly, female sex exacerbates the effects of APOE4 on AD risk and rate of cognitive decline. Therefore, this review evaluates the importance of context for understanding the role of APOE in preclinical mouse models. Specifically, we detail how human AD pathology is mirrored in current transgenic mouse models (“What”) and describe the critical need for introducing human APOE into these mouse models (“Who”). We next outline different methods for introducing human APOE into mice (“How”) and highlight efforts to develop temporally defined and location-specific human apoE expression models (“When” and “Where”). We conclude with the importance of choosing the human APOE mouse model relevant to the question being addressed, using the selection of transgenic models for testing apoE-targeted therapeutics as an example (“Why”).},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegeneration diseases caused by multiple factors. The mechanistic insight of AD remains limited. To disclose molecular mechanisms of AD, many studies have been proposed from transcriptome analyses. However, no analysis across multiple levels of transcription has been conducted to discover co-expression networks of AD. We performed gene-level and isoform-level analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from 544 brain tissues of AD patients, mild cognitive impaired (MCI) patients, and healthy controls. Gene and isoform levels of co-expression modules were constructed by RNA-seq data. The associations of modules with AD were evaluated by integrating cognitive scores of patients, Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), alternative splicing analysis, and dementia-related genes expressed in brain tissues. Totally, 29 co-expression modules were found with expressions significantly correlated with the cognitive scores. Among them, two isoform modules were enriched with AD-associated SNPs and genes whose mRNA splicing displayed significant alteration in relation to AD disease. These two modules were further found enriched with dementia-related genes expressed in four brain regions of 125 AD patients. Analyzing expressions of these two modules revealed expressions of 39 isoforms (corresponding to 35 genes) significantly correlated with cognitive scores of AD patients, in which 38 isoforms were significantly up-regulated in AD patients comparing to controls, and 33 isoforms (corresponding to 29 genes) were not reported as AD-related previously. Employing the co-expression modules and the drug-induced gene expression data from Connectivity Map (CMAP), 12 drugs were predicted as significant in restoring the gene expression of AD patients towards health, which include nine drugs reported for relieving AD. In comparison, four of the top 12 significant drugs were known for relieving AD if the drug prediction was performed by the genes expressed significantly different in AD and healthy controls. Analysis of multiple levels of the transcriptomic organization is useful in suggesting AD-related co-expression networks and discovering drugs.},

abstract = {Summary Protein-coding genes in eukaryotes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and introns are removed from pre-mRNA by the spliceosome. Understanding the time lag between Pol II progression and splicing could provide mechanistic insights into the regulation of gene expression. Here, we present two single-molecule nascent RNA sequencing methods that directly determine the progress of splicing catalysis as a function of Pol II position. Endogenous genes were analyzed on a global scale in budding yeast. We show that splicing is 50{\%} complete when Pol II is only 45 nt downstream of introns, with the first spliced products observed as introns emerge from Pol II. Perturbations that slow the rate of spliceosome assembly or speed up the rate of transcription caused splicing delays, showing that regulation of both processes determines in vivo splicing profiles. We propose that matched rates streamline the gene expression pathway, while allowing regulation through kinetic competition.},

abstract = {Nascent transcripts are the true substrates for many splicing events in mammalian cells. In this review we discuss transcription, splicing, and alternative splicing in the context of co-transcriptional processing of pre-mRNA. The realization that splicing occurs co-transcriptionally requires two important considerations: First, the cis-acting elements in the splicing substrate are synthesized at different times in a 5′ to 3′ direction. This dynamic view of the substrate implies that in a 100 kb intron the 5′ splice site will be synthesized as much as an hour before the 3′ splice site. Second, the transcription machinery and the splicing machinery, which are both complex and very large, are working in close proximity to each other. It is therefore likely that these two macromolecular machines interact, and recent data supporting this notion is discussed. We propose a model for co-transcriptional pre-mRNA processing that incorporates the concepts of splice site-tethering and dynamic exon definition. Also, we present a dynamic view of the alternative splicing of FGF-R2 and suggest that this view could be generally applicable to many regulated splicing events. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Despite the importance of duplicate genes for evolutionary adaptation, accurate gene annotation is often incomplete, incorrect, or lacking in regions of segmental duplication. We developed an approach combining long-read sequencing and hybridization capture to yield full-length transcript information and confidently distinguish between nearly identical genes/paralogs. We used biotinylated probes to enrich for full-length cDNA from duplicated regions, which were then amplified, size-fractionated, and sequenced using single-molecule, long-read sequencing technology, permitting us to distinguish between highly identical genes by virtue of multiple paralogous sequence variants. We examined 19 gene families as expressed in developing and adult human brain, selected for their high sequence identity (average {\textgreater}99{\%}) and overlap with human-specific segmental duplications (SDs).We characterized the transcriptional differences between related paralogs to better understand the birth-death process of duplicate genes and particularly how the process leads to gene innovation. In 48{\%} of the cases, we find that the expressed duplicates have changed substantially from their ancestral models due to novel sites of transcription initiation, splicing, and polyadenylation, as well as fusion transcripts that connect duplication-derived exons with neighboring genes. We detect unannotated open reading frames in genes currently annotated as pseudogenes, while relegating other duplicates to nonfunctional status. Our method significantly improves gene annotation, specifically defining full-length transcripts, isoforms, and open reading frames for new genes in highly identical SDs. The approach will be more broadly applicable to genes in structurally complex regions of other genomes where the duplication process creates novel genes important for adaptive traits.},

abstract = {Recent improvements in experimental and computational techniques that are used to study the transcriptome have enabled an unprecedented view of RNA processing, revealing many previously unknown non-canonical splicing events. This includes cryptic events located far from the currently annotated exons and unconventional splicing mechanisms that have important roles in regulating gene expression. These non-canonical splicing events are a major source of newly emerging transcripts during evolution, especially when they involve sequences derived from transposable elements. They are therefore under precise regulation and quality control, which minimizes their potential to disrupt gene expression. We explain how non-canonical splicing can lead to aberrant transcripts that cause many diseases, and also how it can be exploited for new therapeutic strategies.},

abstract = {Polyploidization contributes to the complexity of gene expression, resulting in numerous related but different transcripts. This study explored the transcriptome diversity and complexity of the tetraploid Arabica coffee (Coffea arabica) bean. Long-read sequencing (LRS) by Pacbio Isoform sequencing (Iso-seq) was used to obtain full-length transcripts without the difficulty and uncertainty of assembly required for reads from short-read technologies. The tetraploid transcriptome was annotated and compared with data from the sub-genome progenitors. Caffeine and sucrose genes were targeted for case analysis. An isoform-level tetraploid coffee bean reference transcriptome with 95 995 distinct transcripts (average 3236 bp) was obtained. A total of 88 715 sequences (92.42{\%}) were annotated with BLASTx against NCBI non-redundant plant proteins, including 34 719 high-quality annotations. Further BLASTn analysis against NCBI non-redundant nucleotide sequences, Coffea canephora coding sequences with UTR, C. arabica ESTs, and Rfam resulted in 1213 sequences without hits, were potential novel genes in coffee. Longer UTRs were captured, especially in the 5'UTRs, facilitating the identification of upstream open reading frames. The LRS also revealed more and longer transcript variants in key caffeine and sucrose metabolism genes from this polyploid genome. Long sequences ({\textgreater}10 kilo base) were poorly annotated. LRS technology shows the limitation of previous studies. It provides an important tool to produce a reference transcriptome including more of the diversity of full-length transcripts to help understand the biology and support the genetic improvement of polyploid species such as coffee.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the histopathological presence of amyloid-b plaques and tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles. Microglial activation is also a recognized pathological component. The relationship between microglial activation and protein aggregation is still debated. We investigated the relationship between amyloid plaques, tau tangles and activated microglia using PET imaging. Fifty-one subjects (19 healthy controls, 16 mild cognitive impairment and 16 Alzheimer's disease subjects) participated in the study. All subjects had neuropsychometric testing, MRI, amyloid ( 18 F-flutemetamol), and microglial ( 11 C-PBR28) PET. All subjects with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease and eight of the controls had tau ( 18 F-AV1451) PET. 11 C-PBR28 PET was analysed using Logan graphical analysis with an arterial plasma input function, while 18 F-flutemetamol and 18 F-AV1451 PET were analysed as target:cerebellar ratios to create parametric standardized uptake value ratio maps. Biological parametric mapping in the Statistical Parametric Mapping platform was used to examine correlations between uptake of tracers at a voxel-level. There were significant widespread clusters of positive correlation between levels of microglial activation and tau aggregation in both the mild cognitive impairment (amyloid-positive and amyloid-negative) and Alzheimer's disease subjects. The correlations were stronger in Alzheimer's disease than in mild cognitive impairment, suggesting that these pathologies increase together as disease progresses. Levels of microglial activation and amyloid deposition were also correlated, although in a different spatial distribution; correlations were stronger in mild cognitive impairment than Alzheimer's subjects, in line with a plateauing of amyloid load with disease progression. Clusters of positive correlations between microglial activation and protein aggregation often targeted similar areas of association cortex, indicating that all three processes are present in specific vulnerable brain areas. For the first time using PET imaging, we show that microglial activation can correlate with both tau aggregation and amyloid deposition. This confirms the complex relationship between these processes. These results suggest that preventative treatment for Alzheimer's disease should target all three processes.},

abstract = {We report the cloning of a novel gene (E5-1) encoded on chromosome 1 which has substantial nucleotide and amino-acid sequence similarity to the S182 gene on chromosome 14q24.3. Mutations, including three new missense mutations in the S182 gene, are associated with the AD3 subtype of early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (AD). Both the E5-1 and the S182 proteins are predicted to be integral membrane proteins with seven membrane-spanning domains, and a large exposed loop between the sixth and seventh transmembrane domains. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the open reading frame (ORF) of the E5-1 gene led to the discovery of two missense substitutions at conserved amino-acid residues in affected members of pedigrees with a form of familial AD that has a later age of onset than the AD3 subtype (50-70 years versus 30-60 years for AD3). These observations imply that the E5-1 gene on chromosome 1 and the S182 gene on chromosome 14q24.3 are members of a family of genes (presenilins) with related functions, and indicates that mutations in conserved residues of E5-1 could also play a role in the genesis of AD. Our results also indicate that still other AD susceptibility genes exist.},

abstract = {In situ analysis of biomarkers is highly desirable in molecular pathology because it allows the examination of biomarker status within the histopathological context of clinical specimens. Immunohistochemistry and DNA in situ hybridization (ISH) are widely used in clinical settings to assess protein and DNA biomarkers, respectively, but clinical use of in situ RNA analysis is rare. This disparity is especially notable when considering the abundance of RNA biomarkers discovered through whole-genome expression profiling. This is largely due to the high degree of technical complexity and insufficient sensitivity and specificity of current RNA ISH techniques. Here, we describe RNAscope, a novel RNA ISH technology with a unique probe design strategy that allows simultaneous signal amplification and background suppression to achieve single-molecule visualization while preserving tissue morphology. RNAscope is compatible with routine formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens and can use either conventional chromogenic dyes for bright-field microscopy or fluorescent dyes for multiplex analysis. Unlike grind-and-bind RNA analysis methods such as real-time RT-PCR, RNAscope brings the benefits of in situ analysis to RNA biomarkers and may enable rapid development of RNA ISH-based molecular diagnostic assays. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the Association for Molecular Pathology.

abstract = {ABCA1 is an ATP-binding cassette protein that transports cellular cholesterol and phospholipids onto high density lipoproteine (HDL) in plasma. Lack of ABCA1 in humans and mice causes abnormal lipidation and increased catabolism of HDL, resulting in very low plasma apoA-I, apoA-II, and HDL. Herein, we have used Abca1-/- mice to ask whether ABCA1 is involved in lipidation of HDL in the central nervous system (CNS). ApoE is the most abundant CNS apolipoprotein and is present in HDL-like lipoproteins in CSF. We found that Abca1-/- mice have greatly decreased apoE levels in both the cortex (80{\%} reduction) and the CSF (98{\%} reduction). CSF from Abca1 -/- mice had significantly reduced cholesterol as well as small apoE-containing lipoproteins, suggesting abnormal lipidation of apoE. Astrocytes, the primary producer of CNS apoE, were cultured from Abca1 +/+, +/-, and -/- mice, and nascent lipoprotein particles were collected. Abca1-/- astrocytes secreted lipoprotein particles that had markedly decreased cholesterol and apoE and had smaller apoE-containing particles than particles from Abca1+/+ astrocytes. These findings demonstrate that ABCA1 plays a critical role in CNS apoE metabolism. Since apoE isoforms and levels strongly influence Alzheimer's disease pathology and risk, these data suggest that ABCA1 may be a novel therapeutic target.},

abstract = {Background: Cathepsin D (CatD) is a lysosomal protease that degrades both the amyloid $\beta$-protein (A$\beta$) and the microtubule-associated protein, tau, and has been genetically linked to late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD). Here, we sought to examine the consequences of genetic deletion of CatD on A$\beta$ proteostasis in vivo and to more completely characterize the degradation of A$\beta$42 and A$\beta$40 by CatD. Methods: We quantified A$\beta$ degradation rates and levels of endogenous A$\beta$42 and A$\beta$40 in the brains of CatD-null (CatD-KO), heterozygous null (CatD-HET), and wild-type (WT) control mice. CatD-KO mice die by {\~{}} 4 weeks of age, so tissues from younger mice, as well as embryonic neuronal cultures, were investigated. Enzymological assays and surface plasmon resonance were employed to quantify the kinetic parameters (K M, k cat) of CatD-mediated degradation of monomeric human A$\beta$42 vs. A$\beta$40, and the degradation of aggregated A$\beta$42 species was also characterized. Competitive inhibition assays were used to interrogate the relative inhibition of full-length human and mouse A$\beta$42 and A$\beta$40, as well as corresponding p3 fragments. Results: Genetic deletion of CatD resulted in 3- to 4-fold increases in insoluble, endogenous cerebral A$\beta$42 and A$\beta$40, exceeding the increases produced by deletion of an insulin-degrading enzyme, neprilysin or both, together with readily detectable intralysosomal deposits of endogenous A$\beta$42 - all by 3 weeks of age. Quite significantly, CatD-KO mice exhibited {\~{}} 30{\%} increases in A$\beta$42/40 ratios, comparable to those induced by presenilin mutations. Mechanistically, the perturbed A$\beta$42/40 ratios were attributable to pronounced differences in the kinetics of degradation of A$\beta$42 vis-{\`{a}}-vis A$\beta$40. Specifically, A$\beta$42 shows a low-nanomolar affinity for CatD, along with an exceptionally slow turnover rate that, together, renders A$\beta$42 a highly potent competitive inhibitor of CatD. Notably, the marked differences in the processing of A$\beta$42 vs. A$\beta$40 also extend to p3 fragments ending at positions 42 vs. 40. Conclusions: Our findings identify CatD as the principal intracellular A$\beta$-degrading protease identified to date, one that regulates A$\beta$42/40 ratios via differential degradation of A$\beta$42 vs. A$\beta$40. The finding that A$\beta$42 is a potent competitive inhibitor of CatD suggests a possible mechanistic link between elevations in A$\beta$42 and downstream pathological sequelae in AD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The majority of protein isoforms arise from alternative splicing of the encoding primary RNA transcripts. To understand the significance of single splicing events, reliable techniques are needed to determine their incidence. However, existing methods are labour-intensive, error-prone or of limited use. RESULTS Here, we present an improved method to determine the relative incidence of transcripts that arise from alternative splicing at a single site. Splice variants were quantified within a single sample using one-step reverse transcription quantitative PCR. Amplification products obtained with variant specific primer pairs were compared to those obtained with primer pairs common to both variants. The identities of variant specific amplicons were simultaneously verified by melt curve analysis. Independent calculations of the relative incidence of each variant were performed. Since the relative incidences of variants have to add upto 100{\%}, the method provides an internal control to monitor experimental errors and uniform reverse transcription. The reliability of the method was tested using mixtures of cDNA templates as well as RNA samples from different sources. CONCLUSION The method described here, is easy to set up and does not need unrelated reference genes and time consuming, error-prone standard curves. It provides a reliable and precise technique to distinguish small differences of the relative incidence of two splice variants.},

abstract = {Background: Many neurodegenerative diseases are caused by nucleotide repeat expansions, but most expansions, like the C9orf72 'GGGGCC' (G4C2) repeat that causes approximately 5-7{\%} of all amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cases, are too long to sequence using short-read sequencing technologies. It is unclear whether long-read sequencing technologies can traverse these long, challenging repeat expansions. Here, we demonstrate that two long-read sequencing technologies, Pacific Biosciences' (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies' (ONT), can sequence through disease-causing repeats cloned into plasmids, including the FTD/ALS-causing G4C2 repeat expansion. We also report the first long-read sequencing data characterizing the C9orf72 G4C2 repeat expansion at the nucleotide level in two symptomatic expansion carriers using PacBio whole-genome sequencing and a no-amplification (No-Amp) targeted approach based on CRISPR/Cas9. Results: Both the PacBio and ONT platforms successfully sequenced through the repeat expansions in plasmids. Throughput on the MinION was a challenge for whole-genome sequencing; we were unable to attain reads covering the human C9orf72 repeat expansion using 15 flow cells. We obtained 8× coverage across the C9orf72 locus using the PacBio Sequel, accurately reporting the unexpanded allele at eight repeats, and reading through the entire expansion with 1324 repeats (7941 nucleotides). Using the No-Amp targeted approach, we attained {\textgreater} 800× coverage and were able to identify the unexpanded allele, closely estimate expansion size, and assess nucleotide content in a single experiment. We estimate the individual's repeat region was {\textgreater} 99{\%} G4C2 content, though we cannot rule out small interruptions. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that long-read sequencing is well suited to characterizing known repeat expansions, and for discovering new disease-causing, disease-modifying, or risk-modifying repeat expansions that have gone undetected with conventional short-read sequencing. The PacBio No-Amp targeted approach may have future potential in clinical and genetic counseling environments. Larger and deeper long-read sequencing studies in C9orf72 expansion carriers will be important to determine heterogeneity and whether the repeats are interrupted by non-G4C2 content, potentially mitigating or modifying disease course or age of onset, as interruptions are known to do in other repeat-expansion disorders. These results have broad implications across all diseases where the genetic etiology remains unclear.},

Furthermore, recent experiments in animal models suggest that therapeutic interventions during sensitive periods, typically before the onset of clear neurological and behavioral symptoms, might prevent or ameliorate the development of specific pathologies. These studies suggest that understanding the dynamic nature of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders is crucial for the development of effective therapies. In this Perspective, I explore the emerging concept of developmental windows in psychiatric disorders, their relevance for understanding disease progression and their potential for the design of new therapies.

This nascent RNA harbours introns that are removed by the spliceosome, which is a megadalton ribonucleoprotein complex that positions the distant ends of the intron into its catalytic centre. Emerging evidence that the catalytic spliceosome is physically close to Pol II in vivo implies that transcription and splicing occur on similar timescales and that the transcription and splicing machineries may be spatially constrained. In this Review, we discuss aspects of spliceosome assembly, transcription elongation and other co-transcriptional events that allow the temporal coordination of co-transcriptional splicing.},

Genome-wide association studies have revolutionized genetic research and have identified over 20 genetic loci associated with late-onset AD. Recently, next-generation sequencing technologies have enabled the identification of rare disease variants, including unmasking small mutations with intermediate risk of AD in PLD3, TREM2, UNC5C, AKAP9, and ADAM10. This review provides an overview of the genetic basis of AD and the relationship between these risk genes and the neuropathologic features of AD.

abstract = {The human genome contains many thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). While several studies have demonstrated compelling biological and disease roles for individual examples, analytical and experimental approaches to investigate these genes have been hampered by the lack of comprehensive lncRNA annotation. Here, we present and analyze the most complete human lncRNA annotation to date, produced by the GENCODE consortium within the framework of the ENCODE project and comprising 9277 manually annotated genes producing 14,880 transcripts. Our analyses indicate that lncRNAs are generated through pathways similar to that of protein-coding genes, with similar histone-modification profiles, splicing signals, and exon/intron lengths. In contrast to protein-coding genes, however, lncRNAs display a striking bias toward two-exon transcripts, they are predominantly localized in the chromatin and nucleus, and a fraction appear to be preferentially processed into small RNAs. They are under stronger selective pressure than neutrally evolving sequences-particularly in their promoter regions, which display levels of selection comparable to protein-coding genes. Importantly, about one-third seem to have arisen within the primate lineage. Comprehensive analysis of their expression in multiple human organs and brain regions shows that lncRNAs are generally lower expressed than protein-coding genes, and display more tissue-specific expression patterns, with a large fraction of tissue-specific lncRNAs expressed in the brain. Expression correlation analysis indicates that lncRNAs show particularly striking positive correlation with the expression of antisense coding genes. This GENCODE annotation represents a valuable resource for future studies of lncRNAs.},

abstract = {Pathological inclusions containing fibrillar aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein are a characteristic feature in tauopathies, which include Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tau is a microtubule-associated protein whose transcript undergoes alternative splicing in the brain. Exon 10 encodes one of four microtubule-binding repeats. Exon 10 inclusion gives rise to tau protein isoforms containing four microtubule-binding repeats (4R) whereas exclusion leads to isoforms containing only three repeats (3R). The ratio between 3R and 4R isoforms is tightly controlled via alternative splicing in the human adult nervous system and distortion of this balance results in neurodegeneration. Previous studies showed that several splicing regulators, among them hTRA2-beta1 and CLK2, regulate exon 10 alternative splicing. Like most splicing factors, htra2-beta and clk2 pre-mRNAs are regulated by alternative splicing. Here, we investigated whether human postmortem brain tissue of AD patients reveal differences in alternative splicing patterns of the tau, htra2-beta, presenilin 2 and clk2 genes when compared with age-matched controls. We found that the splicing patterns of all four genes are altered in affected brain areas of sporadic AD patients. In these affected areas, the amount of mRNAs of tau isoforms including exon 10, the htra2-beta1 isoform and an inactive form of clk2 are significantly increased. These findings suggest that a misregulation of alternative splicing seems to contribute to sporadic AD.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing leverages genomic content by allowing the synthesis of multiple transcripts and, by implication, protein isoforms, from a single gene. However, estimating the abundance of transcripts produced in a given tissue from short sequencing reads is difficult and can result in both the construction of transcripts that do not exist, and the failure to identify true transcripts. An alternative approach is to catalog the events that make up isoforms (splice junctions and exons). We present here the Event Analysis (EA) approach, where we project transcripts onto the genome and identify overlapping/unique regions and junctions. In addition, all possible logical junctions are assembled into a catalog. Transcripts are filtered before quantitation based on simple measures: the proportion of the events detected, and the coverage. We find that mapping to a junction catalog is more efficient at detecting novel junctions than mapping in a splice aware manner. We identify 99.8{\%} of true transcripts while iReckon identifies 82{\%} of the true transcripts and creates more transcripts not included in the simulation than were initially used in the simulation. Using PacBio Iso-seq data from a mouse neural progenitor cell model, EA detects 60{\%} of the novel junctions that are combinations of existing exons while only 43{\%} are detected by STAR. EA further detects ∼5,000 annotated junctions missed by STAR. Filtering transcripts based on the proportion of the transcript detected and the number of reads on average supporting that transcript captures 95{\%} of the PacBio transcriptome. Filtering the reference transcriptome before quantitation, results in is a more stable estimate of isoform abundance, with improved correlation between replicates. This was particularly evident when EA is applied to an RNA-seq study of type 1 diabetes (T1D), where the coefficient of variation among subjects (n = 81) in the transcript abundance estimates was substantially reduced compared to the estimation using the full reference. EA focuses on individual transcriptional events. These events can be quantitate and analyzed directly or used to identify the probable set of expressed transcripts. Simple rules based on detected events and coverage used in filtering result in a dramatic improvement in isoform estimation without the use of ancillary data (e.g. ChIP, long reads) that may not be available for many studies.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease that represents a growing global health crisis. Two major forms of the disease exist: early onset (familial) and late onset (sporadic). Early onset Alzheimer's is rare, accounting for less than 5{\%} of disease burden. It is inherited in Mendelian dominant fashion and is caused by mutations in three genes (APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2). Late onset Alzheimer's is common among individuals over 65 years of age. Heritability of this form of the disease is high (79{\%}), but the etiology is driven by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. A large number of genes have been implicated in the development of late onset Alzheimer's. Examples that have been confirmed by multiple studies include ABCA7, APOE, BIN1, CD2AP, CD33, CLU, CR1, EPHA1, MS4A4A/MS4A4E/MS4A6E, PICALM, and SORL1. Despite tremendous progress over the past three decades, roughly half of the heritability for the late onset of the disease remains unidentified. Finding the remaining genetic factors that contribute to the development of late onset Alzheimer's disease holds the potential to provide novel targets for treatment and prevention, leading to the development of effective strategies to combat this devastating disease.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Long expansions of short tandem repeats (STRs), i.e. DNA repeats of 2-6 nt, are associated with some genetic diseases. Cost-efficient high-throughput sequencing can quickly produce billions of short reads that would be useful for uncovering disease-associated STRs. However, enumerating STRs in short reads remains largely unexplored because of the difficulty in elucidating STRs much longer than 100 bp, the typical length of short reads.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We propose ab initio procedures for sensing and locating long STRs promptly by using the frequency distribution of all STRs and paired-end read information. We validated the reproducibility of this method using biological replicates and used it to locate an STR associated with a brain disease (SCA31). Subsequently, we sequenced this STR site in 11 SCA31 samples using SMRT(TM) sequencing (Pacific Biosciences), determined 2.3-3.1 kb sequences at nucleotide resolution and revealed that (TGGAA)- and (TAAAATAGAA)-repeat expansions determined the instability of the repeat expansions associated with SCA31. Our method could also identify common STRs, (AAAG)- and (AAAAG)-repeat expansions, which are remarkably expanded at four positions in an SCA31 sample. This is the first proposed method for rapidly finding disease-associated long STRs in personal genomes using hybrid sequencing of short and long reads.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Our TRhist software is available at http://trhist.gi.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONTACT: moris@cb.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {The transcription cycle of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) correlates with changes to the phosphorylation state of its large subunit C-terminal domain (CTD). We recently developed Native Elongation Transcript sequencing using mammalian cells (mNET-seq), which generates single-nucleotide-resolution genome-wide profiles of nascent RNA and co-transcriptional RNA processing that are associated with different CTD phosphorylation states. Here we provide a detailed protocol for mNET-seq. First, Pol II elongation complexes are isolated with specific phospho-CTD antibodies from chromatin solubilized by micrococcal nuclease digestion. Next, RNA derived from within the Pol II complex is size fractionated and Illumina sequenced. Using mNET-seq, we have previously shown that Pol II pauses at both ends of protein-coding genes but with different CTD phosphorylation patterns, and we have also detected phosphorylation at serine 5 (Ser5-P) CTD-specific splicing intermediates and Pol II accumulation over co-transcriptionally spliced exons. With moderate biochemical and bioinformatic skills, mNET-seq can be completed in ∼6 d, not including sequencing and data analysis.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia worldwide with no curative therapies currently available. Previously, global transcriptome analysis of AD brains by microarray failed to identify the set of consistently deregulated genes for biomarker development of AD. Therefore, the molecular pathogenesis of AD remains largely unknown. Whole RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is an innovative technology for the comprehensive transcriptome profiling on a genome-wide scale that overcomes several drawbacks of the microarray-based approach. To identify biomarker genes for AD, we analyzed a RNA-Seq dataset composed of the comprehensive transcriptome of autopsized AD brains derived from two independent cohorts. We identified the core set of 522 genes deregulated in AD brains shared between both, compared with normal control subjects. They included downregulation of neuronal differentiation 6 (NeuroD6), a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor involved in neuronal development, differentiation, and survival in AD brains of both cohorts. We verified the results of RNA-Seq by analyzing three microarray datasets of AD brains different in brain regions, ethnicities, and microarray platforms. Thus, both RNA-Seq and microarray data analysis indicated consistent downregulation of NeuroD6 in AD brains. These results suggested that downregulation of NeuroD6 serves as a possible biomarker for AD brains.},

A$\beta$ accumulation in the brain is proposed to be an early toxic event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, which is the most common form of dementia associated with plaques and tangles in the brain. Currently, it is unclear what the physiological and pathological forms of A$\beta$ are and by what mechanism A$\beta$ causes dementia. Moreover, there are no efficient drugs to stop or reverse the progression of Alzheimer's disease. In this paper, we review the structures, biological functions, and neurotoxicity role of A$\beta$. We also discuss the potential receptors that interact with A$\beta$ and mediate A$\beta$ intake, clearance, and metabolism. Additionally, we summarize the therapeutic developments and recent advances of different strategies for treating Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we will report on the progress in searching for novel, potentially effective agents as well as selected promising strategies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. These prospects include agents acting on A$\beta$, its receptors and tau protein, such as small molecules, vaccines and antibodies against A$\beta$; inhibitors or modulators of $\beta$-A nd {\^{I}} 3-secretase; A$\beta$-degrading proteases; tau protein inhibitors and vaccines; amyloid dyes and microRNAs.},

Patient-derived NRXN1+/− hiPSC-neurons show a greater than twofold reduction in half of the wild-type NRXN1$\alpha$ isoforms and express dozens of novel isoforms from the mutant allele. Reduced neuronal activity in patient-derived NRXN1+/− hiPSC-neurons is ameliorated by overexpression of individual control isoforms in a genotype-dependent manner, whereas individual mutant isoforms decrease neuronal activity levels in control hiPSC-neurons. In a genotype-dependent manner, the phenotypic impact of patient-specific NRXN1+/− mutations can occur through a reduction in wild-type NRXN1$\alpha$ isoform levels as well as the presence of mutant NRXN1$\alpha$ isoforms.},

Errors include numerous indels and complicate downstream analysis like mapping or de novo assembly.

Mapping of short reads on long reads provides sufficient coverage to eliminate up to 99{\%} of errors, however, at the expense of prohibitive running times and considerable amounts of disk and memory space. Results: We present LoRDEC, a hybrid error correction method that builds a succinct de Bruijn graph representing the short reads, and seeks a corrective sequence for each erroneous region in the long reads by traversing chosen paths in the graph. In comparison, LoRDEC is at least six times faster and requires at least 93{\%} less memory or disk space than available tools, while achieving comparable accuracy.},

Although evidence strongly suggests that non-coding RNAs are important in a variety of biological phenomena, the discovery of small peptide-coding mRNAs confirms that some transcripts that have been assumed to be non-coding actually have coding potential. Their abundance and importance in biological phenomena makes the sorting of non-coding RNAs from small peptide-coding mRNAs a key issue in functional genomics. However, validating the coding potential of small peptide-coding RNAs is complicated, because their ORF sequences are usually too short for computational analysis.

This phenomenon has been extensively studied in bulk tissues, however, it remains unclear how this diversity is reflected in single cells. RESULTS Here we use long-read sequencing technology combined with unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to reveal patterns of alternative full-length isoform expression in single cells from the mouse brain. We found a surprising amount of isoform diversity, even after applying a conservative definition of what constitutes an isoform. Genes tend to have one or a few isoforms highly expressed and a larger number of isoforms expressed at a low level. However, for many genes, nearly every sequenced mRNA molecule was unique, and many events affected coding regions suggesting previously unknown protein diversity in single cells. Exon junctions in coding regions were less prone to splicing errors than those in non-coding regions, indicating purifying selection on splice donor and acceptor efficiency. CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicate that mRNA isoform diversity is an important source of biological variability also in single cells.},

We also developed a robust data analysis pipeline for repeat element analysis that is independent of alignment of reads to a reference genome. The method was applied to 11 diagnostic blood samples, and for all 22 alleles the resulting CAG repeat count agreed with previous results based on fragment analysis. The amplification-free protocol also allowed for studying somatic variability of repeat elements in our samples, without the interference of PCR stutter.

Recombinants between the APP gene and the AD locus have been reported which seemed to exclude it as the site of the mutation causing familial AD. But recent genetic analysis of a large number of AD families has demonstrated that the disease is heterogeneous. Families with late-onset AD do not show linkage to chromosome 21 markers. Some families with early-onset AD show linkage to chromosome 21 markers, but some do not. This has led to the suggestion that there is non-allelic genetic heterogeneity even within early onset familial AD. To avoid the problems that heterogeneity poses for genetic analysis, we have examined the cosegregation of AD and markers along the long arm of chromosome 21 in a single family with AD confirmed by autopsy. Here we demonstrate that in this kindred, which shows linkage to chromosome 21 markers, there is a point mutation in the APP gene. This mutation causes an amino-acid substitution (Val----Ile) close to the carboxy terminus of the beta-amyloid peptide. Screening other cases of familial AD revealed a second unrelated family in which this variant occurs. This suggests that some cases of AD could be caused by mutations in the APP gene.},

abstract = {Curli are functional amyloid fibres that constitute the major protein component of the extracellular matrix in pellicle biofilms formed by Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria (predominantly of the $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ 3 classes). They provide a fitness advantage in pathogenic strains and induce a strong pro-inflammatory response during bacteraemia. Curli formation requires a dedicated protein secretion machinery comprising the outer membrane lipoprotein CsgG and two soluble accessory proteins, CsgE and CsgF. Here we report the X-ray structure of Escherichia coli CsgG in a non-lipidated, soluble form as well as in its native membrane-extracted conformation. CsgG forms an oligomeric transport complex composed of nine anticodon-binding-domain-like units that give rise to a 36-stranded $\beta$ 2-barrel that traverses the bilayer and is connected to a cage-like vestibule in the periplasm. The transmembrane and periplasmic domains are separated by a 0.9-nm channel constriction composed of three stacked concentric phenylalanine, asparagine and tyrosine rings that may guide the extended polypeptide substrate through the secretion pore. The specificity factor CsgE forms a nonameric adaptor that binds and closes off the periplasmic face of the secretion channel, creating a 24,000 {\AA} 3 pre-constriction chamber. Our structural, functional and electrophysiological analyses imply that CsgG is an ungated, non-selective protein secretion channel that is expected to employ a diffusion-based, entropy-driven transport mechanism.},

abstract = {The minor allele of rs11136000 within CLU is strongly associated with reduced Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. The mechanism underlying this association is unclear. Here, we report that CLU1 and CLU2 are the two primary CLU isoforms in human brain; CLU1 and CLU2 share exons 2-9 but differ in exon 1 and proximal promoters. The expression of both CLU1 and CLU2 was increased in individuals with significant AD neuropathology. However, only CLU1 was associated with the rs11136000 genotype, with the minor "protective" rs11136000T allele being associated with increased CLU1 expression. Since CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins, respectively, we compared their expression; for both CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells, clusterin is present in the secretory pathway, accumulates in the extracellular media, and is similar in size to clusterin in human brain. Overall, we interpret these results as indicating that the AD-protective minor rs11136000T allele is associated with increased CLU1 expression. Since CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce similar proteins and are increased in AD, the AD-protection afforded by the rs11136000T allele may reflect increased soluble clusterin throughout life.},

abstract = {FMR1 premutation carriers (55-200 CGG repeats) are at risk for developing Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS), an adult onset neurodegenerative disorder. Approximately 20{\%} of female carriers will develop Fragile X-associated Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (FXPOI), in addition to a number of clinical problems affecting premutation carriers throughout their life span. Marked elevation in FMR1 mRNA levels have been observed with premutation alleles resulting in RNA toxicity, the leading molecular mechanism proposed for the FMR1 associated disorders observed in premutation carriers. The FMR1 gene undergoes alternative splicing and we have recently reported that the relative abundance of all FMR1 mRNA isoforms is significantly increased in premutation carriers. In this study, we characterized the transcriptional FMR1 isoforms distribution pattern in different tissues and identified a total of 49 isoforms, some of which observed only in premutation carriers and which might play a role in the pathogenesis of FXTAS. Further, we investigated the distribution pattern and expression levels of the FMR1 isoforms in asymptomatic premutation carriers and in those with FXTAS and found no significant differences between the two groups. Our findings suggest that the characterization of the expression levels of the different FMR1 isoforms is fundamental for understanding the regulation of the FMR1 gene as imbalance in their expression could lead to an altered functional diversity with neurotoxic consequences. Their characterization will also help to elucidating the mechanism(s) by which "toxic gain of function" of the FMR1 mRNA may play a role in FXTAS and/or in the other FMR1-associated conditions.},

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs, whose deregulation has been associated with neurodegeneration in PD. In this study, miRNAs targeting cell death and/or inflammation pathways were selected and their expression compared in the serum of PD patients and healthy controls. We used two independent cohorts (discovery and validation) of 20 idiopathic PD patients (iPD) and 20 healthy controls each. We also analyzed an additional group of 45 patients with a mutation in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene (LRRK2-PD). miRNA expression was determined using Taqman qRT-PCR and their performance to discriminate between groups was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. We found miR-146a, miR-335-3p, and miR-335-5p downregulated in iPD and LRRK2-PD patients versus controls in both cohorts. In addition, miR-155 was upregulated in LRRK2-PD compared to iPD patients showing an appropriate value of area under the ROC curve (AUC 0.80) to discriminate between the two groups. In conclusion, our study identified a panel of inflammatory related miRNAs differentially expressed between PD patients and healthy controls that highlight key pathophysiological processes and may contribute to improve disease diagnosis.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, characterized by accumulation of amyloid $\beta$ (A$\beta$) and neurofibrillary tangles. Oxidative stress and inflammation are considered to play an important role in the development and progression of AD. However, the extent to which these events contribute to the A$\beta$ pathologies remains unclear. We performed inter-species comparative gene expression profiling between AD patient brains and the App NL-G-F/NL-G-F and 3xTg-AD-H mouse models. Genes commonly altered in App NL-G-F/NL-G-F and human AD cortices correlated with the inflammatory response or immunological disease. Among them, expression of AD-related genes (C4a/C4b, Cd74, Ctss, Gfap, Nfe2l2, Phyhd1, S100b, Tf, Tgfbr2, and Vim) was increased in the App NL-G-F/NL-G-F cortex as A$\beta$ amyloidosis progressed with exacerbated gliosis, while genes commonly altered in the 3xTg-AD-H and human AD cortices correlated with neurological disease. The App NL-G-F/NL-G-F cortex also had altered expression of genes (Abi3, Apoe, Bin2, Cd33, Ctsc, Dock2, Fcer1g, Frmd6, Hck, Inpp5D, Ly86, Plcg2, Trem2, Tyrobp) defined as risk factors for AD by genome-wide association study or identified as genetic nodes in late-onset AD. These results suggest a strong correlation between cortical A$\beta$ amyloidosis and the neuroinflammatory response and provide a better understanding of the involvement of gender effects in the development of AD.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies are identifying novel Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk factors. Elucidating the mechanism underlying these polymorphisms is critical to the validation process and, by identifying rate-limiting steps in AD risk, may yield novel therapeutic targets. Here, we elucidate the mechanism of action of the AD-associated polymorphism rs3865444 in the promoter of CD33, a member of the sialic acid-binding Ig-superfamily of lectins (SIGLECs). Immunostaining established that CD33 is expressed in microglia in human brain. Consistent with this finding, CD33 mRNA expression correlated well with expression of the microglial genesCD11bandAIF-1 and was modestly increased with AD status and the rs3865444C AD-risk allele. Analysis of CD33 isoforms identified a common isoform lacking exon 2 (D2-CD33). The proportion of CD33 expressed as D2-CD33 correlated robustly with rs3865444 genotype. Because rs3865444 is in the CD33 promoter region, we sought the functional polymorphism by sequencing CD33 from the promoter through exon 4. We identified a single polymorphism that is coinherited with rs3865444, i.e., rs12459419 in exon 2. Minigene RNA splicing studies in BV2 microglial cells established that rs12459419 is a functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that modulates exon 2 splicing efficiency. Thus, our primary findings are that CD33 is a microglial mRNA and that rs3865444 is a proxy SNP for rs12459419 that modulates CD33 exon 2 splicing. Exon 2 encodes the CD33 IgV domain that typically mediates sialic acid binding in SIGLEC family members. In summary, these results suggest a novel model where in SNP-modulated RNA splicing modulates CD33 function and, there by, AD risk. {\textcopyright} 2013 the authors.},

Following an iterative clustering algorithm to obtain full-length-only consensus seed sequences, non-full-length reads were aligned to seed consensus for final consensus calling using Quiver. Because the Clontech kit can miss 5' ends on degraded RNA, transcripts were further collapsed if they have 5' difference less than 100 bp and are otherwise identical. Alternative splicing of RNA is an important mechanism that increases protein diversity and is pervasive in the most complex biological functions. While advances in RNA sequencing methods have accelerated our understanding of the transcriptome, isoform discovery remains computationally challenging due to short read lengths. Here, we describe the Isoform Sequencing (Iso-Seq) method using long reads generated by the PacBio RS II. We sequenced rat heart and lung RNA using the Clontech {\textregistered} SMARTer {\textregistered} cDNA preparation kit followed by size selection using agarose gel. Additionally, we tested the BluePippin™ device from Sage Science for efficiently extracting longer transcripts ≥ 3 kb. Post-sequencing, we developed a novel isoform-level clustering algorithm to generate high-quality transcript consensus sequences. We show that our method recovered alternative splice forms as well as alternative stop sites, antisense transcription, and retained introns.

Traditional Chinese Medicine formulations from Astragalus membranaceus have been used to treat a wide range of illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, nephritis and cancers. Pharmacological studies have shown that immunomodulating, anti-hyperglycemic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiviral activities exist in the extract of Astragalus membranaceus. Therefore, characterising the biosynthesis of bioactive compounds in Astragalus membranaceus, such as Astragalosides, Calycosin and Calycosin-7-O-$\beta$-d-glucoside, is of particular importance for further genetic studies of Astragalus membranaceus. In this study, we reconstructed the Astragalus membranaceus full-length transcriptomes from leaf and root tissues using PacBio Iso-Seq long reads. We identified 27 975 and 22 343 full-length unique transcript models in each tissue respectively. Compared with previous studies that used short read sequencing, our reconstructed transcripts are longer, and are more likely to be full-length and include numerous transcript variants. Moreover, we also re-characterised and identified potential transcript variants of genes involved in Astragalosides, Calycosin and Calycosin-7-O-$\beta$-d-glucoside biosynthesis. In conclusion, our study provides a practical pipeline to characterise the full-length transcriptome for species without a reference genome and a useful genomic resource for exploring the biosynthesis of active compounds in Astragalus membranaceus.},

abstract = {Background: Despite the economic importance of sugarcane in sugar and bioenergy production, there is not yet a reference genome available. Most of the sugarcane transcriptomic studies have been based on Saccharum officinarum gene indices (SoGI), expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and de novo assembled transcript contigs from short-reads; hence knowledge of the sugarcane transcriptome is limited in relation to transcript length and number of transcript isoforms. Results: The sugarcane transcriptome was sequenced using PacBio isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) of a pooled RNA sample derived from leaf, internode and root tissues, of different developmental stages, from 22 varieties, to explore the potential for capturing full-length transcript isoforms. A total of 107,598 unique transcript isoforms were obtained, representing about 71{\%} of the total number of predicted sugarcane genes. The majority of this dataset (92{\%}) matched the plant protein database, while just over 2{\%} was novel transcripts, and over 2{\%} was putative long non-coding RNAs. About 56{\%} and 23{\%} of total sequences were annotated against the gene ontology and KEGG pathway databases, respectively. Comparison with de novo contigs from Illumina RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) of the internode samples from the same experiment and public databases showed that the Iso-Seq method recovered more full-length transcript isoforms, had a higher N50 and average length of largest 1,000 proteins; whereas a greater representation of the gene content and RNA diversity was captured in RNA-Seq. Only 62{\%} of PacBio transcript isoforms matched 67{\%} of de novo contigs, while the non-matched proportions were attributed to the inclusion of leaf/root tissues and the normalization in PacBio, and the representation of more gene content and RNA classes in the de novo assembly, respectively. About 69{\%} of PacBio transcript isoforms and 41{\%} of de novo contigs aligned with the sorghum genome, indicating the high conservation of orthologs in the genic regions of the two genomes. Conclusions: The transcriptome dataset should contribute to improved sugarcane gene models and sugarcane protein predictions; and will serve as a reference database for analysis of transcript expression in sugarcane.},

abstract = {We previously described a splice donor site mutation in intron 4 of presenilin-1 (PSEN1) in two patients with autopsy-confirmed early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we provide evidence that the intron 4 mutation is present in four additional unrelated early-onset AD cases, that the mutation segregates in an autosomal dominant manner and that all cases have one common ancestor. We demonstrate that the infron 4 mutation produces three different transcripts, two deletion transcripts ($\Delta$4 and $\Delta$4(cryptic)) and one insertion transcript (ins(TAC)), by aberrant splicing. The deletion transcripts result in the formation of C-truncated ({\~{}} 7 kDa) PSEN1 proteins while the insertion transcript produces a full-length PSEN1 with one extra amino acid (Thr) inserted between codons 113 and 114 (PSEN1 T113-114ins).

abstract = {MiR-335-3p, a neuron-enriched microRNA, has been reported to be involved in aging and age-related neurological diseases. However, the role of miR-335-3p in cholesterol metabolism of astrocytes, and whether it affects neuronal functions, particularly during aging process, largely remains unknown. In this study, we uncover that miR-335-3p is significantly increased in aged cultured astrocytes and aged hippocampal brains, accompanied by decreased cellular cholesterol and diminished expression of HMGCR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase-1 (HMGCS1), both step-limiting enzymes in cholesterol synthesis pathway. We also demonstrate that miR-335-3p suppresses HMGCS1 post-transcriptionally by directly binding to its 3′UTR, and HMGCR through binding mediated by SFRS2. More importantly, aged mice with miR-335-3p deficiency in hippocampal brains exhibit improved learning and memory, accompanied by enhanced levels of postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95). We further reveal that the level change of PSD95 is resulted from altered cholesterol metabolism. Our findings provide a novel insight into the regulatory role of miR-335-3p in cholesterol metabolism in astrocytes, and consequently cognitive functions during aging.},

The underlying genetic mechanism of SCZ remains unknown, but studies indicate that the disease is associated with a global gene expression disturbance across many genes. Next-generation sequencing, particularly of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), provides a powerful genome-scale technology to investigate the pathological processes of SCZ. RNA-Seq has been used to analyze the gene expressions and identify the novel splice isoforms and rare transcripts associated with SCZ. This paper provides an overview on the genetics of SCZ, the advantages of RNA-Seq for transcriptome analysis, the accomplishments of RNA-Seq in SCZ cohorts, and the applications of induced pluripotent stem cells and RNA-Seq in SCZ research.},

Regional densities of senile plaques (SP), neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and astrocytes in the cornu ammonis (CA), subiculum and entorhinal cortex were measured and differences in these densities among Alzheimer's disease (AD), NAND and NC were statistically compared. Densities of NFT in the CA and subiculum were significantly higher in AD than in NAND, and densities of SP in all regions were significantly higher in AD than in NAND. Similarly, NFT density in the subiculum and SP density in all regions were higher in AD than in NC. Regional densities of astrocytes in most regions were closely correlated with those of Alzheimer changes. In conclusion, the attribution of the Alzheimer changes, particularly of NFT, to dementia is neglected when they are confined to the entorhinal cortex. However, the attribution of the Alzheimer changes to dementia should be appreciated when they spread from the entorhinal cortex to the subiculum and/or CA.},

abstract = {Tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with Tau pathology (FTLD-tau), are a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by Tau hyperphosphorylation. Post-translational modifications of Tau such as phosphorylation and truncation have been demonstrated to be an essential step in the molecular pathogenesis of these tauopathies. In this work, we demonstrate the existence of a new, human-specific truncated form of Tau generated by intron 12 retention in human neuroblastoma cells and, to a higher extent, in human RNA brain samples, using qPCR and further confirming the results on a larger database of human RNA-seq samples. Diminished protein levels of this new Tau isoform are found by Westernblotting in Alzheimer's patients' brains (Braak I n = 3; Braak II n = 6, Braak III n = 3, Braak IV n = 1, and Braak V n = 10, Braak VI n = 8) with respect to non-demented control subjects (n = 9), suggesting that the lack of this truncated isoform may play an important role in the pathology. This new Tau isoform exhibits similar post-transcriptional modifications by phosphorylation and affinity for microtubule binding, but more interestingly, is less prone to aggregate than other Tau isoforms. Finally, we present evidence suggesting this new Tau isoform could be linked to the inhibition of GSK3$\beta$, which would mediate intron 12 retention by modulating the serine/arginine rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2). Our results show the existence of an important new isoform of Tau and suggest that further research on this less aggregation-prone Tau may help to develop future therapies for Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies.},

Fetal brain mQTLs were primarily cis-acting, enriched in regulatory chromatin domains and transcription factor binding sites, and showed substantial overlap with genetic variants that were also associated with gene expression in the brain. Using tissue from three distinct regions of the adult brain (prefrontal cortex, striatum and cerebellum), we found that most fetal brain mQTLs were developmentally stable, although a subset was characterized by fetal-specific effects. Fetal brain mQTLs were enriched amongst risk loci identified in a recent large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) of schizophrenia, a severe psychiatric disorder with a hypothesized neurodevelopmental component. Finally, we found that mQTLs can be used to refine GWAS loci through the identification of discrete sites of variable fetal brain methylation associated with schizophrenia risk variants.},

Splicing profiles are particularly diverse in brain and difficult to accurately identify and quantify. We developed a new approach to address this challenge, combining long-range PCR and nanopore sequencing with a novel bioinformatics pipeline. We identify the full-length coding transcripts of CACNA1C in human brain. CACNA1C is a psychiatric risk gene that encodes the voltage-gated calcium channel CaV1.2. We show that CACNA1C's transcript profile is substantially more complex than appreciated, identifying 38 novel exons and 241 novel transcripts. Importantly, many of the novel variants are abundant, and predicted to encode channels with altered function. The splicing profile varies between brain regions, especially in cerebellum. We demonstrate that human transcript diversity (and thereby protein isoform diversity) remains under-characterised, and provide a feasible and cost-effective methodology to address this. A detailed understanding of isoform diversity will be essential for the translation of psychiatric genomic findings into pathophysiological insights and novel psychopharmacological targets.},

The program maps and aligns a single sequence with minimal startup time and memory requirements, and provides fast batch processing of large sequence sets. The program generates accurate gene structures, even in the presence of substantial polymorphisms and sequence errors, without using probabilistic splice site models. Methodology underlying the program includes a minimal sampling strategy for genomic mapping, oligomer chaining for approximate alignment, sandwich DP for splice site detection, and microexon identification with statistical significance testing. RESULTS: On a set of human messenger RNAs with random mutations at a 1 and 3{\%} rate, GMAP identified all splice sites accurately in over 99.3{\%} of the sequences, which was one-tenth the error rate of existing programs. On a large set of human expressed sequence tags, GMAP provided higher-quality alignments more often than blat did. On a set of Arabidopsis cDNAs, GMAP performed comparably with GeneSeqer. In these experiments, GMAP demonstrated a several-fold increase in speed over existing programs.

abstract = {Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) is a promising susceptibility gene for major mental illness, but the mechanism of the clinical association is unknown. We searched for DISC1 transcripts in adult and fetal human brain and tested whether their expression is altered in patients with schizophrenia and is associated with genetic variation in DISC1. Many alternatively spliced transcripts were identified, including groups lacking exon 3 (Delta3), exons 7 and 8 (Delta7Delta8), an exon 3 insertion variant (extra short variant-1, Esv1), and intergenic splicing between TSNAX and DISC1. Isoforms Delta7Delta8, Esv1, and Delta3, which encode truncated DISC1 proteins, were expressed more abundantly during fetal development than during postnatal ages, and their expression was higher in the hippocampus of patients with schizophrenia. Schizophrenia risk-associated polymorphisms [non-synonymous SNPs rs821616 (Cys704Ser) and rs6675281 (Leu607Phe), and rs821597] were associated with the expression of Delta3 and Delta7Delta8. Moreover, the same allele at rs6675281, which predicted higher expression of these transcripts in the hippocampus, was associated with higher expression of DISC1Delta7Delta8 in lymphoblasts in an independent sample. Our results implicate a molecular mechanism of genetic risk associated with DISC1 involving specific alterations in gene processing.},

The central role of NMD in the control of gene expression requires the existence of buffering mechanisms that tightly regulate the magnitude of this pathway. Here, we will focus on the mechanism of NMD with an emphasis on the role of RNA helicases in the transition from NMD complexes that recognize a PTC to those that promote mRNA decay. We will also review recent strategies aimed at uncovering novel trans-acting factors and their functional role in the NMD pathway. Finally, we will describe recent progress in the study of the physiological role of the NMD response.},

abstract = {The MAPT (microtubule-associated protein tau) locus is one of the most remarkable in neurogenetics due not only to its involvement in multiple neurodegenerative disorders, including progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, Parksinson's disease and possibly Alzheimer's disease, but also due its genetic evolution and complex alternative splicing features which are, to some extent, linked and so all the more intriguing. Therefore, obtaining robust information regarding the expression, splicing and genetic regulation of this gene within the human brain is of immense importance. In this study, we used 2011 brain samples originating from 439 individuals to provide the most reliable and coherent information on the regional expression, splicing and regulation of MAPT available to date. We found significant regional variation in mRNA expression and splicing of MAPT within the human brain. Furthermore, at the gene level, the regional distribution of mRNA expression and total tau protein expression levels were largely in agreement, appearing to be highly correlated. Finally and most importantly, we show that while the reported H1/H2 association with gene level expression is likely to be due to a technical artefact, this polymorphism is associated with the expression of exon 3-containing isoforms in human brain. These findings would suggest that contrary to the prevailing view, genetic risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases at the MAPT locus are likely to operate by changing mRNA splicing in different brain regions, as opposed to the overall expression of the MAPT gene. {\textcopyright} The Author 2012.

abstract = {The degradation of different isoforms of human recombinant tau (R-tau; T39, T40, and T44) and fetal tau (F-tau) by cathepsin D (CD) was investigated. Gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining of different R- tau species digested at pH 3.5 showed very little differences in CD susceptibility. Immunoblotting analyses revealed that amino and carboxy termini of tau were cleaved before other regions. F-tau was most vulnerable to proteolysis at both termini. Digestion of R-tau with 0.01 unit of CD/ml at pH 3.5 resulted in cleavage between Phe8-Glu9, Met419-Val420, Thr427-Leu426-Ala429, and Leu436-Ala437 as determined by amino acid sequencing and mass spectroscopy (numbering of amino acids was based on T40). With higher concentrations of CD (1 unit/ml), additional sites of digestion were detected between amine acids 34-161, 200-257, and 267-358. The cleavage sites at amine acids 34-161 and 267-358 were observed at pH 3.5, whereas that at amine acids 200-257 was detected at pH 7.0. Our results suggest that CD cleavage of tau could generate tau fragments with intact microtubule binding domains, which could have a role in the pathogenesis of paired helical filaments (PHFs) in Alzheimer's disease. Such proteolysis might also contribute to the changes of PHF phenotype observed in intracellular and extracellular tangles.},

We discover 30 brain coexpression modules from seven regions as the major source of AD transcriptional perturbations. We next examine overlap with 251 brain differentially expressed gene sets from mouse models of AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Human-mouse overlaps highlight responses to amyloid versus tau pathology and reveal age- and sex-dependent expression signatures for disease progression. Human coexpression modules enriched for neuronal and/or microglial genes broadly overlap with mouse models of AD, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and aging. Other human coexpression modules, including those implicated in proteostasis, are not activated in AD models but rather following other, unexpected genetic manipulations. Our results comprise a cross-species resource, highlighting transcriptional networks altered by human brain pathophysiology and identifying correspondences with mouse models for AD preclinical studies.},

Although a draft genome sequence was published already, the sequences and completed structure of mRNA transcripts remain unclear, which limit further explore on red clover. Results: In this study, the red clover transcriptome was sequenced using single-molecule long-read sequencing to identify full-length splice isoforms, and 29,730 novel isoforms from known genes and 2194 novel isoforms from novel genes were identified. A total of 5492 alternative splicing events was identified and the majority of alter spliced events in red clover was corrected as intron retention. In addition, of the 15,229 genes detected by SMRT, 8719 including 186,517 transcripts have at least one poly(A) site. Furthermore, we identified 4333 long non-coding RNAs and 3762 fusion transcripts. Conclusions: We analyzed full-length transcriptome of red clover with PacBio SMRT. Those new findings provided important information for improving red clover draft genome annotation and fully characterization of red clover transcriptome.},

However, the definition of AD has been confounded with dementia in many studies. Thus, overinterpretation of genetic findings with regard to mechanisms and drug targets may explain, in part, controversies in the field. Here, we analyze the different forms of genetic risk of AD and how these can be used to model disease. We stress the importance of studying gene variants in the right cell types and in the right pathological context. The lack of mechanistic understanding of genetic variation has become the major bottleneck in the search for new drug targets for AD.},

abstract = {Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) is used as an alternative to single-cell RNA-seq, as it allows transcriptomic profiling of frozen tissue. However, it is unclear whether snRNA-seq is able to detect cellular state in human tissue. Indeed, snRNA-seq analyses of human brain samples have failed to detect a consistent microglial activation signature in Alzheimer's disease. Our comparison of microglia from single cells and single nuclei of four human subjects reveals that, although most genes show similar relative abundances in cells and nuclei, a small population of genes (∼1{\%}) is depleted in nuclei compared to whole cells. This population is enriched for genes previously implicated in microglial activation, including APOE, CST3, SPP1, and CD74, comprising 18{\%} of previously identified microglial-disease-associated genes. Given the low sensitivity of snRNA-seq to detect many activation genes, we conclude that snRNA-seq is not suited for detecting cellular activation in microglia in human disease. Thrupp et al. demonstrate the depletion of a small population of genes in nuclei relative to cells in human microglia by using single-nucleus and single-cell sequencing. This population is enriched for microglial activation genes, suggesting that single-nucleus sequencing is not suited for the detection of microglial activation in humans.},

@article{Angelini2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The main goal of the whole transcriptome analysis is to correctly identify all expressed transcripts within a specific cell/tissue--at a particular stage and condition--to determine their structures and to measure their abundances. RNA-seq data promise to allow identification and quantification of transcriptome at unprecedented level of resolution, accuracy and low cost. Several computational methods have been proposed to achieve such purposes. However, it is still not clear which promises are already met and which challenges are still open and require further methodological developments. RESULTS: We carried out a simulation study to assess the performance of 5 widely used tools, such as: CEM, Cufflinks, iReckon, RSEM, and SLIDE. All of them have been used with default parameters. In particular, we considered the effect of the following three different scenarios: the availability of complete annotation, incomplete annotation, and no annotation at all. Moreover, comparisons were carried out using the methods in three different modes of action. In the first mode, the methods were forced to only deal with those isoforms that are present in the annotation; in the second mode, they were allowed to detect novel isoforms using the annotation as guide; in the third mode, they were operating in fully data driven way (although with the support of the alignment on the reference genome). In the latter modality, precision and recall are quite poor. On the contrary, results are better with the support of the annotation, even though it is not complete. Finally, abundance estimation error often shows a very skewed distribution. The performance strongly depends on the true real abundance of the isoforms. Lowly (and sometimes also moderately) expressed isoforms are poorly detected and estimated. In particular, lowly expressed isoforms are identified mainly if they are provided in the original annotation as potential isoforms. CONCLUSIONS: Both detection and quantification of all isoforms from RNA-seq data are still hard problems and they are affected by many factors. Overall, the performance significantly changes since it depends on the modes of action and on the type of available annotation. Results obtained using complete or partial annotation are able to detect most of the expressed isoforms, even though the number of false positives is often high. Fully data driven approaches require more attention, at least for complex eucaryotic genomes. Improvements are desirable especially for isoform quantification and for isoform detection with low abundance.},

Hypothesis: dysregulated with increase in truncated APOE-005 isoform

Result: RT-qPCR findings not replicated. relative quanification in matched cohort showed no differences in total APOE, APOE-005, APOE-001 between AD cases and control. 

No differences in transcript levels between individuals with and without APOE e4 allele. 
No relationship between neuron number, plaque density, total NFTS etc and expression level of APOE transcripts 

Conclusion: "dysregulation of APOE expression is not a common occurence in AD", suggests that APOE alternative transcription is unaffected in STG of AD brains. This contrasts with Twine et al. attributing disparate findings to RNA-seq's small smapling frame (single A sample for each region and possible that AD sample was taken from a severely affected area, and relative neuronal loss between this sample and pooled control sample would have led to an apparent upregulation of glial-derived genes such as APOE. With severely affected area, alternative transcription pattern may reflect termianl transcriptional dysregulation rather than mechanism of driving disease progression). RIN disparity in Twine et al studies as AD temporal lobe RIN (6.9) lower than poled control sampe (7.3). 

Method: 14 AD vs 16 controls STG tissues},

To that end, we integrated AD GWAS results with human brain proteomes to perform a proteome-wide association study (PWAS) of AD, followed by Mendelian randomization and colocalization analysis. We identified 11 genes that are consistent with being causal in AD, acting via their cis-regulated brain protein abundance. Nine replicated in a confirmation PWAS and eight represent new AD risk genes not identified before by AD GWAS. Furthermore, we demonstrated that our results were independent of APOE e4. Together, our findings provide new insights into AD pathogenesis and promising targets for further mechanistic and therapeutic studies.},

The degree of neuropathologic change was compared with the severity of dementia, as assessed by the Blessed Dementia Scale and duration of illness. We found that (1) the severity of dementia was positively related to the number of NFTs in neocortex, but not to the degree of SP deposition; (2) NFTs accumulate in a consistent pattern reflecting hierarchic vulnerability of individual cytoarchitectural fields; (3) NFTs appeared in the entorhinal cortex, CA1/subiculum field of the hippocampal formation, and the amygdala early in the disease process; and (4) the degree of SP deposition was also related to a hierarchic vulnerability of certain brain areas to accumulate SPs, but the pattern of SP distribution was different from that of NFT. {\textcopyright} 1992 American Academy of Neurology.},

abstract = {With the recent advances in high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), biologists are able to measure transcription with unprecedented precision. One problem that can now be tackled is that of isoform quantification: here one tries to reconstruct the abundances of isoforms of a gene. We have developed a statistical solution for this problem, based on analyzing a set of RNA-Seq reads, and a practical implementation, available from archive.gersteinlab.org/proj/rnaseq/IQSeq, in a tool we call IQSeq (Isoform Quantification in next-generation Sequencing). Here, we present theoretical results which IQSeq is based on, and then use both simulated and real datasets to illustrate various applications of the tool. In order to measure the accuracy of an isoform-quantification result, one would try to estimate the average variance of the estimated isoform abundances for each gene (based on resampling the RNA-seq reads), and IQSeq has a particularly fast algorithm (based on the Fisher Information Matrix) for calculating this, achieving a speedup of {\~{}} 500 times compared to brute-force resampling. IQSeq also calculates an information theoretic measure of overall transcriptome complexity to describe isoform abundance for a whole experiment. IQSeq has many features that are particularly useful in RNA-Seq experimental design, allowing one to optimally model the integration of different sequencing technologies in a cost-effective way. In particular, the IQSeq formalism integrates the analysis of different sample (i.e. read) sets generated from different technologies within the same statistical framework. It also supports a generalized statistical partial-sample-generation function to model the sequencing process. This allows one to have a modular, "plugin-able" read-generation function to support the particularities of the many evolving sequencing technologies.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing is a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism producing multiple distinct mRNA molecules from a single pre-mRNA. Alternative splicing has a prominent role in the central nervous system, impacting neurodevelopment and various neuronal functions as well as being increasingly implicated in brain disorders including autism, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. Standard short-read RNA-Seq approaches only sequence fragments of the mRNA molecule, making it difficult to accurately characterize the true nature of RNA isoform diversity. In this study, we used long-read isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) to generate full-length cDNA sequences and map transcript diversity in the human and mouse cerebral cortex. We identify widespread RNA isoform diversity amongst expressed genes in the cortex, including many novel transcripts not present in existing genome annotations. Alternative splicing events were found to make a major contribution to RNA isoform diversity in the cortex, with intron retention being a relatively common event associated with nonsense-mediated decay and reduced transcript expression. Of note, we found evidence for transcription from novel (unannotated genes) and fusion events between neighbouring genes. Although global patterns of RNA isoform diversity were found to be generally similar between human and mouse cortex, we identified some notable exceptions. We also identified striking developmental changes in transcript diversity, with differential transcript usage between human adult and fetal cerebral cortex. Finally, we found evidence for extensive isoform diversity in genes associated with autism, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. Our data confirm the importance of alternative splicing in the cerebral cortex, dramatically increasing transcriptional diversity and representing an important mechanism underpinning gene regulation in the brain.

Different tissues and families of genes differentially use distinct types of promoters. Our tagging methods allow quantitative analysis of promoter usage in different tissues and show that differentially regulated alternative TSSs are a common feature in protein-coding genes and commonly generate alternative N termini.

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing-based methods and their applications in the study of transcriptomes have revolutionized our understanding of alternative splicing. Networks of functionally coordinated and biologically important alternative splicing events continue to be discovered in an ever-increasing diversity of cell types in the context of physiologically normal and disease states. These studies have been complemented by efforts directed at defining sequence codes governing splicing and their cognate trans-acting factors, which have illuminated important combinatorial principles of regulation. Additional studies have revealed critical roles of position-dependent, multivalent protein-RNA interactions that direct splicing outcomes. Investigations of evolutionary changes in RNA binding proteins, splice variants, and associated cis elements have further shed light on the emergence, mechanisms, and functions of splicing networks. Progress in these areas has emphasized the need for a coordinated, community-based effort to systematically address the functions of individual splice variants associated with normal and disease biology.},

abstract = {Our vision of DNA transcription and splicing has changed dramatically with the introduction of short-read sequencing. These high-throughput sequencing technologies promised to unravel the complexity of any transcriptome. Generally gene expression levels are well-captured using these technologies, but there are still remaining caveats due to the limited read length and the fact that RNA molecules had to be reverse transcribed before sequencing. Oxford Nanopore Technologies has recently launched a portable sequencer which offers the possibility of sequencing long reads and most importantly RNA molecules. Here we generated a full mouse transcriptome from brain and liver using the Oxford Nanopore device. As a comparison, we sequenced RNA (RNA-Seq) and cDNA (cDNA-Seq) molecules using both long and short reads technologies and tested the TeloPrime preparation kit, dedicated to the enrichment of full-length transcripts. Using spike-in data, we confirmed that expression levels are efficiently captured by cDNA-Seq using short reads. More importantly, Oxford Nanopore RNA-Seq tends to be more efficient, while cDNA-Seq appears to be more biased. We further show that the cDNA library preparation of the Nanopore protocol induces read truncation for transcripts containing internal runs of T's. This bias is marked for runs of at least 15 T's, but is already detectable for runs of at least 9 T's and therefore concerns more than 20{\%} of expressed transcripts in mouse brain and liver. Finally, we outline that bioinformatics challenges remain ahead for quantifying at the transcript level, especially when reads are not full-length. Accurate quantification of repeat-associated genes such as processed pseudogenes also remains difficult, and we show that current mapping protocols which map reads to the genome largely over-estimate their expression, at the expense of their parent gene.},

This picture has changed with advances in the systematic annotation of functional noncoding elements. Evolutionary conservation, functional genomics, chromatin state, sequence motifs and molecular quantitative trait loci all provide complementary information about the function of noncoding sequences. These functional maps can help with prioritizing variants on risk haplotypes, filtering mutations encountered in the clinic and performing systems-level analyses to reveal processes underlying disease associations. Advances in predictive modeling can enable data-set integration to reveal pathways shared across loci and alleles, and richer regulatory models can guide the search for epistatic interactions. Lastly, new massively parallel reporter experiments can systematically validate regulatory predictions. Ultimately, advances in regulatory and systems genomics can help unleash the value of whole-genome sequencing for personalized genomic risk assessment, diagnosis and treatment.},

abstract = {Proteogenomics, i.e. comprehensive integration of genomics and proteomics data, is a powerful approach identifying novel protein biomarkers. This is especially the case for proteins that differ structurally between disease and control conditions. As tumor development is associated with aberrant splicing, we focus on this rich source of cancer specific biomarkers. To this end, we developed a proteogenomic pipeline, Splicify, which is able to detect differentially expressed protein isoforms. Splicify is based on integrating RNA massive parallel sequencing data and tandem mass spectrometry proteomics data to identify protein isoforms resulting from differential splicing between two conditions. Proof of concept was obtained by applying Splicify to RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry data obtained from colorectal cancer cell line SW480, before and after siRNA-mediated down-modulation of the splicing factors SF3B1 and SRSF1. These analyses revealed 2172 and 149 differentially expressed isoforms, respectively, with peptide confirmation upon knock-down of SF3B1 and SRSF1 compared to their controls. Splice variants identified included RAC1, OSBPL3, MKI67 and SYK. One additional sample was analyzed by PacBio Iso-Seq full-length transcript sequencing after SF3B1 down-modulation. This analysis verified the alternative splicing identified by Splicify and in addition identified novel splicing events that were not represented in the human reference genome annotation. Therefore, Splicify offers a validated proteogenomic data analysis pipeline for identification of disease specific protein biomarkers resulting from mRNA alternative splicing. Splicify is publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/NKI-TGO/SPLICIFY) and suitable to address basic research questions using pre-clinical model systems as well as translational research questions using patient-derived samples, e.g. allowing to identify clinically relevant biomarkers.},

The highly-contiguous de novo assemblies using PacBio sequencing can close gaps in current reference assemblies and characterize structural variation (SV) in personal genomes. With longer reads, we can sequence through extended repetitive regions and detect mutations, many of which are associated with diseases. Moreover, PacBio transcriptome sequencing is advantageous for the identification of gene isoforms and facilitates reliable discoveries of novel genes and novel isoforms of annotated genes, due to its ability to sequence full-length transcripts or fragments with significant lengths. Additionally, PacBio's sequencing technique provides information that is useful for the direct detection of base modifications, such as methylation. In addition to using PacBio sequencing alone, many hybrid sequencing strategies have been developed to make use of more accurate short reads in conjunction with PacBio long reads. In general, hybrid sequencing strategies are more affordable and scalable especially for small-size laboratories than using PacBio Sequencing alone. The advent of PacBio sequencing has made available much information that could not be obtained via SGS alone.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Bentham Science Publishers. Background/Objectives: Increasing evidence suggests the importance of neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is a complex neurodegenerative disorder. Complement activation occurs in the brain of patients with AD and seems to contribute to an important local inflammatory state. Increased expression of the fourth serum complement component 4 (C4) has been observed in AD patients in many studies. This protein has two isoforms, encoded by two genes: C4A and C4B localized to the HLA class III region. These genes exhibit copy number variations (CNVs) and this different gene copy number can influence C4 protein levels. We focalized our attention on these two genes, determining the distribution of CNVs in AD patients, compared with healthy controls, in order to analyse their possible involvement in AD pathogenesis. Methods: We investigated 191 AD patients and 300 healthy controls. The C4A and C4B copy numbers were assessed by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Results: The results obtained showed a statistically significant increase in the number of copies for both C4A and C4B in AD patients, compared with healthy controls (p{\textless}0,001). Conclusion: The presence of high C4A and C4B copy numbers in AD patients could explain the increased C4 protein expression observed in AD patients, thus highlighting a possible role for C4A and C4B CNVs in the risk of developing AD.},

Considerable evidence indicates that these transcripts act directly as functional RNAs rather than through an encoded protein product. However, a recent study of ribosome occupancy reported that many large intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs) are bound by ribosomes, raising the possibility that they are translated into proteins. Here, we show that classical noncoding RNAs and 50 UTRs show the same ribosome occupancy as lincRNAs, demonstrating that ribosome occupancy alone is not sufficient to classify transcripts as coding or noncoding. Instead, we define a metric based on the known property of translation whereby translating ribosomes are released upon encountering a bona fide stop codon. We show that this metric accurately discriminates between protein-coding transcripts and all classes of known noncoding transcripts, including lincRNAs. Taken together, these results argue that the large majority of lincRNAs do not function through encoded proteins.},

abstract = {Background: Alternative Splicing (AS) as a post-transcription regulation mechanism is an important application of RNA-seq studies in eukaryotes. A number of software and computational methods have been developed for detecting AS. Most of the methods, however, are designed and tested on animal data, such as human and mouse. Plants genes differ from those of animals in many ways, e.g., the average intron size and preferred AS types. These differences may require different computational approaches and raise questions about their effectiveness on plant data. The goal of this paper is to benchmark existing computational differential splicing (or transcription) detection methods so that biologists can choose the most suitable tools to accomplish their goals. Results: This study compares the eight popular public available software packages for differential splicing analysis using both simulated and real Arabidopsis thaliana RNA-seq data. All software are freely available. The study examines the effect of varying AS ratio, read depth, dispersion pattern, AS types, sample sizes and the influence of annotation. Using a real data, the study looks at the consistences between the packages and verifies a subset of the detected AS events using PCR studies. Conclusions: No single method performs the best in all situations. The accuracy of annotation has a major impact on which method should be chosen for AS analysis. DEXSeq performs well in the simulated data when the AS signal is relative strong and annotation is accurate. Cufflinks achieve a better tradeoff between precision and recall and turns out to be the best one when incomplete annotation is provided. Some methods perform inconsistently for different AS types. Complex AS events that combine several simple AS events impose problems for most methods, especially for MATS. MATS stands out in the analysis of real RNA-seq data when all the AS events being evaluated are simple AS events.},

abstract = {Impact statement Most signals from genome-wide associ-ation studies (GWASs) map to the non-coding genome, and functional interpret-ation of these associations remained challenging. We reviewed recent progress in methodologies of studying the non-coding genome and argued that no single approach allows one to effectively identify the causal regulatory variants from GWAS results. By illustrating the advantages and limitations of each method, our review potentially provided a guideline for taking a combinatorial approach to accurately predict, prioritize, and eventually experi-mentally validate the causal variants. Abstract Genome-wide association studies have shown that the far majority of disease-associated variants reside in the non-coding regions of the genome, suggesting that gene regulatory changes contribute to disease risk. To identify truly causal non-coding variants and their affected target genes remains challenging but is a critical step to translate the genetic associations to molecular mechanisms and ultimately clinical applications. Here we review genomic/epigenomic resources and in silico tools that can be used to identify causal non-coding variants and experimental strategies to validate their functionalities.},

abstract = {Abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein is a common event in many neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. We investigated the relationship between hyperphosphorylated tau in brain extracts and mnemonic functions in rTg4510 mouse model of tauopathy. We report that rTg4510 mice showed rapid deterioration in spatial learning and memory, which paralleled a significant increase of hyperphosphorylated tau in the brain between 3 and 5.5 months of age. At 5.5 months, rTg4510 females showed significantly higher levels of hyperphosphorylated tau than males, with no evidence of differential tau transgene expression between the sexes. The increased levels of hyperphosphorylated tau in females were associated with more severe impairment in spatial learning and memory as compared to transgenic males. We also showed that within studied age range, the decrease in memory performance was accompanied by other behavioral disturbances in the water maze related to search strategy, like thigmotaxic swim and cue response. These findings suggest that the onset of abnormal tau biochemistry and coincident cognitive deficits in the rTg4510 mouse model is sex-dependent with females being affected earlier and more aggressively than males. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Although eukaryotic cells express a wide range of alternatively spliced transcripts, it is not clear whether genes tend to express a range of transcripts simultaneously across cells, or produce dominant isoforms in a manner that is either tissue-specific or regardless of tissue. To date, large-scale investigations into the pattern of transcript expression across distinct tissues have produced contradictory results. Here, we attempt to determine whether genes express a dominant splice variant at the protein level. We interrogate peptides from eight large-scale human proteomics experiments and databases and find that there is a single dominant protein isoform, irrespective of tissue or cell type, for the vast majority of the protein-coding genes in these experiments, in partial agreement with the conclusions from the most recent large-scale RNAseq study. Remarkably, the dominant isoforms from the experimental proteomics analyses coincided overwhelmingly with the reference isoforms selected by two completely orthogonal sources, the consensus coding sequence variants, which are agreed upon by separate manual genome curation teams, and the principal isoforms from the APPRIS database, predicted automatically from the conservation of protein sequence, structure, and function.},

abstract = {To examine the length of a hexanucleotide expansion in C9orf72, which represents the most frequent genetic cause of frontotemporal lobar degeneration and motor neuron disease, we employed a targeted amplification-free long-read sequencing technology: No-Amp sequencing. In our cross-sectional study, we assessed cerebellar tissue from 28 well-characterized C9orf72 expansion carriers. We obtained 3507 on-target circular consensus sequencing reads, of which 814 bridged the C9orf72 repeat expansion (23{\%}). Importantly, we observed a significant correlation between expansion sizes obtained using No-Amp sequencing and Southern blotting (P = 5.0 × 10-4). Interestingly, we also detected a significant survival advantage for individuals with smaller expansions (P = 0.004). Additionally, we uncovered that smaller expansions were significantly associated with higher levels of C9orf72 transcripts containing intron 1b (P = 0.003), poly(GP) proteins (P = 1.3 × 10- 5), and poly(GA) proteins (P = 0.005). Thorough examination of the composition of the expansion revealed that its GC content was extremely high (median: 100{\%}) and that it was mainly composed of GGGGCC repeats (median: 96{\%}), suggesting that expanded C9orf72 repeats are quite pure. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that No-Amp sequencing is a powerful tool that enables the discovery of relevant clinicopathological associations, highlighting the important role played by the cerebellar size of the expanded repeat in C9orf72-linked diseases.},

We first perform a large genetic association study by merging all available case-control datasets and by-proxy study results (discovery n = 409,435 and validation size n = 58,190). Here, we add six variants associated with Alzheimer's disease risk (near APP, CHRNE, PRKD3/NDUFAF7, PLCG2 and two exonic variants in the SHARPIN gene). Assessment of the polygenic risk score and stratifying by APOE reveal a 4 to 5.5 years difference in median age at onset of Alzheimer's disease patients in APOE ɛ4 carriers. Because of this study, the underlying mechanisms of APP can be studied to refine the amyloid cascade and the polygenic risk score provides a tool to select individuals at high risk of Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {RNA sequencing using next-generation sequencing technologies (NGS) is currently the standard approach for gene expression profiling, particularly for large-scale high-throughput studies. NGS technologies comprise high throughput, cost efficient short-read RNA-Seq, while emerging single molecule, long-read RNA-Seq technologies have enabled new approaches to study the transcriptome and its function. The emerging single molecule, long-read technologies are currently commercially available by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), while new methodologies based on short-read sequencing approaches are also being developed in order to provide long range single molecule level information—for example, the ones represented by the 10x Genomics linked read methodology. The shift toward long-read sequencing technologies for transcriptome characterization is based on current increases in throughput and decreases in cost, making these attractive for de novo transcriptome assembly, isoform expression quantification, and in-depth RNA species analysis. These types of analyses were challenging with standard short sequencing approaches, due to the complex nature of the transcriptome, which consists of variable lengths of transcripts and multiple alternatively spliced isoforms for most genes, as well as the high sequence similarity of highly abundant species of RNA, such as rRNAs. Here we aim to focus on single molecule level sequencing technologies and single-cell technologies that, combined with perturbation tools, allow the analysis of complete RNA species, whether short or long, at high resolution. In parallel, these tools have opened new ways in understanding gene functions at the tissue, network, and pathway levels, as well as their detailed functional characterization. Analysis of the epi-transcriptome, including RNA methylation and modification and the effects of such modifications on biological systems is now enabled through direct RNA sequencing instead of classical indirect approaches. However, many difficulties and challenges remain, such as methodologies to generate full-length RNA or cDNA libraries from all different species of RNAs, not only poly-A containing transcripts, and the identification of allele-specific transcripts due to current error rates of single molecule technologies, while the bioinformatics analysis on long-read data for accurate identification of 5′ and 3′ UTRs is still in development.},

abstract = {The brain pathology of Alzheimer's disease is characterized by abnormally aggregated A$\beta$ in extracellular $\beta$-amyloid plaques and along blood vessel walls, but the relation to intracellular A$\beta$ remains unclear. To address the role of intracellular A$\beta$ deposition in vivo, we expressed human APP with the combined Swedish and Arctic mutations in mice (arcA$\beta$ mice). Intracellular punctate deposits of A$\beta$ occurred concomitantly with robust cognitive impairments at the age of 6 months before the onset of $\beta$-amyloid plaque formation and cerebral $\beta$-amyloid angiopathy. $\beta$-Amyloid plaques from arcA$\beta$ mice had distinct dense-core morphologies with blood vessels appearing as seeding origins, suggesting reduced clearance of A$\beta$ across blood vessels in arcA$\beta$ mice. The co-incidence of intracellular A$\beta$ deposits with behavioral deficits support an early role of intracellular A$\beta$ in the pathophysiological cascade leading to $\beta$-amyloid formation and functional impairment. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Context: Blood-based analytes may be indicators of pathological processes in Alzheimer disease (AD). Objective: To identify plasma proteins associated with AD pathology using a combined proteomic and neuro-imaging approach. Design: Discovery-phase proteomics to identify plasma proteins associated with correlates of AD pathology. Confirmation and validation using immunodetection in a replication set and an animal model. Setting: A multicenter European study (AddNeuroMed) and the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Participants: Patients with AD, subjects with mild cognitive impairment, and healthy controls with standardized clinical assessments and structural neuroimaging. Main Outcome Measures: Association of plasma proteins with brain atrophy, disease severity, and rate of clinical progression. Extension studies in humans and transgenic mice tested the association between plasma proteins and brain amyloid. Results: Clusterin/apolipoprotein J was associated with atrophy of the entorhinal cortex, baseline disease severity, and rapid clinical progression in AD. Increased plasma concentration of clusterin was predictive of greater fibrillar amyloid-$\beta$ burden in the medial temporal lobe. Subjects with AD had increased clusterin messenger RNA in blood, but there was no effect of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene encoding clusterin with gene or protein expression. APP/PS1 transgenic mice showed increased plasma clusterin, age-dependent increase in brain clusterin, as well as amyloid and clusterin colocalization in plaques. Conclusions: These results demonstrate an important role of clusterin in the pathogenesis of AD and suggest that alterations in amyloid chaperone proteins may be a biologically relevant peripheral signature of AD. {\textcopyright}2010 American Medical Association.

The top findings in the discovery sample were also followed-up in the ADSP whole-genome sequenced family-based dataset (197 members of 42 EA families and 501 members of 157 CH families). We identified novel and predicted functional genetic variants in genes previously associated with AD. We also detected associations in three novel genes: IGHG3 (p = 9.8 × 10−7), an immunoglobulin gene whose antibodies interact with $\beta$-amyloid, a long non-coding RNA AC099552.4 (p = 1.2 × 10−7), and a zinc-finger protein ZNF655 (gene-based p = 5.0 × 10−6).

abstract = {Citrullinated proteins are the products of a posttranslational process in which arginine residues undergo modification into citrulline residues when catalyzed by peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) in a calcium ion-dependent manner. In our previous report, PAD2 expressed mainly in the rat cerebrum became activated early in the neurodegenerative process. To elucidate the involvement of protein citrullination in human neuronal degeneration, we examined whether citrullinated proteins are produced during Alzheimer's disease (AD). By Western blot analysis with antimodified citrulline antibody, citrullinated proteins of varied molecular weights were detected in hippocampal tissues from patients with AD but not normal humans. Two of the citrullinated proteins were identified as vimentin and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) by using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Interestingly, PAD2 was detected in hippocampal extracts from AD and normal brains, but the amount of PAD2 in the AD tissue was markedly greater. Histochemical analysis revealed citrullinated proteins throughout the hippocampus, especially in the dentate gyrus and stratum radiatum of CA1 and CA2 areas. However, no citrullinated proteins were detected in the normal hippocampus. PAD2 immunoreactivity was also ubiquitous throughout both the AD and the normal hippocampal areas. PAD2 enrichment coincided well with citrullinated protein positivity. Double immunofluorescence staining revealed that citrullinated protein- and PAD2-positive cells also coincided with GFAP-positive cells, but not all GFAP-positive cells were positive for PAD2. As with GFAP, which is an astrocyte-specific marker protein, PAD2 is distributed mainly in astrocytes. These collective results, the abnormal accumulation of citrullinated proteins and abnormal activation of PAD2 in hippocampi of patients with AD, strongly suggest that PAD has an important role in the onset and progression of AD and that citrullinated proteins may become a useful marker for human neurodegenerative diseases. {\textcopyright} 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Background: Laboratory assays evaluating the effect of DNA sequence variants on BRCA1 mRNA splicing may contribute to classification by providing molecular evidence. However, our knowledge of normal and aberrant BRCA1 splicing events to date has been limited to data derived from assays targeting partial transcript sequences. This study explored the utility of nanopore sequencing to examine whole BRCA1 mRNA transcripts and to provide accurate categorisation of in-frame and out-of-frame splicing events. Methods: The exon structure of BRCA1 transcripts from a previously studied control lymphoblastoid cell line were assessed using MinION nanopore sequencing of long-range reverse transcriptase-PCR amplicons. Results: Our study identified and characterised 32 complete BRCA1 isoforms, including 18 novel isoforms which showed skipping of multiple contiguous and/or non-contiguous exons. Furthermore, we show that known BRCA1 exon skipping events, such as $\Delta$(9,10) and $\Delta$21, can co-occur in a single transcript, with some isoforms containing four or more alternative splice junctions. Fourteen novel isoforms were formed entirely from a combination of previously identified alternative splice junctions, suggesting that the total number of BRCA1 isoforms might be lower than the number of splicing events reported previously. Conclusions: Our results highlight complexity in BRCA1 transcript structure that has not been described previously. This finding has key implications for predicting the translation frame of splicing transcripts, important for interpreting the clinical significance of spliceogenic variants. Future research is warranted to quantitatively assess full-length BRCA1 transcript levels, and to assess the application of nanopore sequencing for routine evaluation of potential spliceogenic variants.},

Here, we review the potential and challenges of direct molecular characterization of the postmortem human brain, and provide a brief overview of recent transcriptional and epigenetic studies with respect to neuropsychiatric disorders. Such information can now be leveraged and integrated with the growing number of genome-wide association databases to provide a functional context of trait-associated genetic variants linked to psychiatric illnesses and related phenotypes.

abstract = {Objective: To study the prevalence and age dependency of senile plaques (SP) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), the brain changes characteristic of Alzheimer disease (AD), and their association with apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes in a community-dwelling normal population. Methods: This neuropathological study used both silver staining and A$\beta$ immunohistochemistry in brain tissue microarrays, including SP coverage and NFT counts from frontal cortex and hippocampus, and APOE genotyping, and was performed on a consecutive prospective series of 603 subjects (aged between 0 and 97 years) of an unselected population living outside of institutions. Cases were subjected to autopsy following sudden or unexpected out-of-hospital death, covering 22.1{\%} of the mortality of Tampere, Finland and its surroundings. None died of AD, although 22 (3.7{\%}) were demented and 10 (1.7{\%}) had memory problems. Results: Of the series, 30.8{\%} had SP, and 42.1{\%} had NFT; these occurred more commonly among females and showed a strong relationship with age. Both changes had already appeared at around 30 years of age, reaching an occurrence of almost 100{\%} in the oldest. SP were more frequent in APOE $\epsilon$4-carriers compared with noncarriers in every age group except the oldest ({\textgreater}90 years). The difference was most evident during the ages 50 to 59 years, where 40.7{\%} of $\epsilon$4-carriers had SP, compared with 8.2{\%} in noncarriers (odds ratio, 8.39; 95{\%} confidence interval, 2.55-27.62). The difference in NFT prevalence between APOE genotypes was not statistically significant in any age group. Interpretation: The brain changes associated with AD may already begin developing early in middle age, especially among APOE $\epsilon$4 carriers. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Neurological Association.},

Many clinicians find this a difficult question to answer. AIMS: To provide information for old age psychiatrists wishing to advise relatives of their risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. METHOD: A selective review of the key literature on the genetic epidemiology of Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS: Currently a DNA diagnosis is attainable in some 70{\%} of families with autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease. In first-degree relatives of most cases, risk is increased some three- or four-fold relative to controls, but only one-third of this is realised in the average life span. Apolipoprotein E genotyping cannot be used as a predictive test and confers only minimal diagnostic benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Pedigrees with familial Alzheimer's disease should be referred to a Regional Centre for Medical Genetics. Accurate risk prediction is not possible in the vast majority of pedigrees with Alzheimer's disease, although it is possible for the psychiatrist to give a rough estimate of the risk, which can reasonably the couched in reassuring terms.},

abstract = {Although the function of DNA methylation in gene promoter regions is well established in transcriptional repression, the function of the evolutionarily conserved widespread distribution of DNA methylation in gene body regions remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that DNA methylation is enriched in included alternatively spliced exons (ASEs), and that inhibition of DNA methylation results in aberrant splicing of ASEs. The methyl-CpG-binding protein MeCP2 is enriched in included ASEs, particularly those that are also highly methylated, and inhibition of DNA methylation disrupts specific targeting of MeCP2 to exons. Interestingly, ablation of MeCP2 results in increased histone acetylation and aberrant ASE-skipping events. We further show that inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity leads to exon skipping that shows a highly significant degree of overlap with that caused by MeCP2 knockdown. Together, our data indicate that intragenic DNA methylation operates in exon definition to modulate alternative RNA splicing and can enhance exon recognition via recruitment of the multifunctional protein MeCP2, which thereby maintains local histone hypoacetylation through the subsequent recruitment of HDACs.},

Translational role of MeCP2 
Mutations in MeCP2 account for neurodevelopmental disorder (Rett syndrome), autism, therefore to be able to elucidate role of MeCP2 to DNA methylation as cause of altered pre-mRNA splicing, as contributing factor to disease development

Evidence:
1) Genome-wide analysis of CPG methylation in exons vs introns, and more specifically in inclusion exons

2) Global demethylation with 5-Aza-C --{\textgreater} introns previously associated with higher levels of methylation, downregulated --{\textgreater} abberant exon exclusion
increased acetylation levels 

3) Association of MeCP2 wih included exons and positive correlation with DNA methylation
Knockdown of MeCP2 resulted in abberant exclusion of exons (by number of upregulated/downregulated AES vs control) 

4) chemical inhibition of HDAC activity resulted in similar events as KO of MeCP2 therefore overlap of pathways 

Role of transcription elongation: 



Plausible mechanism for enhanced ASE inclusion: 
a) exonic DNA methylation 
b) recruitment/enhanced activity of MeCP2 
c) recruitment of HDACs to maintain low acetylation levels (histone hypoacetylase influences rate of PolII mediated transcriptional elongation --{\textgreater} increased time to recognise and ASEs in final transcript)},

abstract = {The pervasive expression of circular RNAs (circRNAs) is a recently discovered feature of gene expression in highly diverged eukaryotes. Numerous algorithms that are used to detect genome-wide circRNA expression from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data have been developed in the past few years, but there is little overlap in their predictions and no clear gold-standard method to assess the accuracy of these algorithms. We review sources of experimental and bioinformatic biases that complicate the accurate discovery of circRNAs and discuss statistical approaches to address these biases. We conclude with a discussion of the current experimental progress on the topic.},

abstract = {Motivation: New long read sequencing technologies, like PacBio SMRT and Oxford NanoPore, can produce sequencing reads up to 50 000 bp long but with an error rate of at least 15{\%}. Reducing the error rate is necessary for subsequent utilization of the reads in, e.g. de novo genome assembly. The error correction problem has been tackled either by aligning the long reads against each other or by a hybrid approach that uses the more accurate short reads produced by second generation sequencing technologies to correct the long reads. Results: We present an error correction method that uses long reads only. The method consists of two phases: first, we use an iterative alignment-free correction method based on de Bruijn graphs with increasing length of k-mers, and second, the corrected reads are further polished using longdistance dependencies that are found using multiple alignments. According to our experiments, the proposed method is the most accurate one relying on long reads only for read sets with high coverage. Furthermore, when the coverage of the read set is at least 75x, the throughput of the new method is at least 20{\%} higher.},

abstract = {Adult mammalian axon regeneration is generally successful in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) but is dismally poor in the central nervous system (CNS). However, many classes of CNS axons can extend for long distances in peripheral nerve grafts. A comparison of myelin from the CNS and the PNS has revealed that CNS white matter is selectively inhibitory for axonal outgrowth. Several components of CNS white matter, NI35, NI250(Nogo) and MAG, that have inhibitory activity for axon extension have been described. The IN-1 antibody, which recognizes NI35 and NI250(Nogo), allows moderate degrees of axonal regeneration and functional recovery after spinal cord injury. Here we identify Nogo as a member of the Reticulon family, Reticulon 4-A. Nogo is expressed by oligodendrocytes but not by Schwann cells, and associates primarily with the endoplasmic reticulum. A 66-residue lumenal/extracellular domain inhibits axonal extension and collapses dorsal root ganglion growth cones. In contrast to Nogo, Reticulon 1 and 3 are not expressed by oligodendrocytes, and the 66-residue lumenal/extracellular domains from Reticulon 1, 2 and 3 do not inhibit axonal regeneration. These data provide a molecular basis to assess the contribution of Nogo to the failure of axonal regeneration in the adult CNS.},

abstract = {Genes play a strong role in Alzheimer's disease (AD), with late-onset AD showing heritability of 58–79{\%} and early-onset AD showing over 90{\%}. Genetic association provides a robust platform to build our understanding of the etiology of this complex disease. Over 50 loci are now implicated for AD, suggesting that AD is a disease of multiple components, as supported by pathway analyses (immunity, endocytosis, cholesterol transport, ubiquitination, amyloid-$\beta$ and tau processing). Over 50{\%} of late-onset AD heritability has been captured, allowing researchers to calculate the accumulation of AD genetic risk through polygenic risk scores. A polygenic risk score predicts disease with up to 90{\%} accuracy and is an exciting tool in our research armory that could allow selection of those with high polygenic risk scores for clinical trials and precision medicine. It could also allow cellular modelling of the combined risk. Here we propose the multiplex model as a new perspective from which to understand AD. The multiplex model reflects the combination of some, or all, of these model components (genetic and environmental), in a tissue-specific manner, to trigger or sustain a disease cascade, which ultimately results in the cell and synaptic loss observed in AD.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a detrimental neurodegenerative disease with no effective treatments. Due to cellular heterogeneity, defining the roles of immune cell subsets in AD onset and progression has been challenging. Using transcriptional single-cell sorting, we comprehensively map all immune populations in wild-type and AD-transgenic (Tg-AD) mouse brains. We describe a novel microglia type associated with neurodegenerative diseases (DAM) and identify markers, spatial localization, and pathways associated with these cells. Immunohistochemical staining of mice and human brain slices shows DAM with intracellular/phagocytic A$\beta$ particles. Single-cell analysis of DAM in Tg-AD and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2)−/− Tg-AD reveals that the DAM program is activated in a two-step process. Activation is initiated in a Trem2-independent manner that involves downregulation of microglia checkpoints, followed by activation of a Trem2-dependent program. This unique microglia-type has the potential to restrict neurodegeneration, which may have important implications for future treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Video Abstract},

abstract = {ABCA1 is a cholesterol transporter that is widely expressed throughout the body. Outside the central nervous system (CNS), ABCA1 functions in the biogenesis of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), where it mediates the efflux of cholesterol and phospholipids to apolipoprotein (apo) A-I. Deficiency of ABCA1 results in lack of circulating HDL and greatly reduced levels of apoA-I. ABCA1 is also expressed in cells within the CNS, but its roles in brain lipid metabolism are not yet fully understood. In the brain, glia synthesize the apolipoproteins involved in CNS lipid metabolism. Here we demonstrate that glial ABCA1 is required for cholesterol efflux to apoA-I and plays a key role in facilitating cholesterol efflux to apoE, which is the major apolipoprotein in the brain. In both astrocytes and microglia, ABCA1 deficiency reduces lipid efflux to exogenous apoE. The impaired ability to efflux lipids in ABCA1 -/- glia results in lipid accumulation in both astrocytes and microglia under normal culture conditions. Additionally, apoE secretion is compromised in ABCA1 -/- astrocytes and microglia. In vivo, deficiency of ABCA1 results in a 65{\%} decrease in apoE levels in whole brain, and a 75-80{\%} decrease in apoE levels in hippocampus and striatum. Additionally, the effect of ABCA1 on apoE is selective, as apoJ levels are unchanged in brains of ABCA1 -/- mice. Taken together, these results show that glial ABCA1 is a key influence on apoE metabolism in the CNS.},

Simultaneously, they highlight brain region- and cell-type-specific expression patterns, and alternative splicing events that affect the straightforward relation between a genetic variant and AD, re-emphasizing the need for an integrated approach of genetics and transcriptomics in understanding AD.},

abstract = {Intron retention (IR) by alternative splicing is a conserved regulatory mechanism that can affect gene expression and protein function during adult development and age-onset diseases. However, it remains unclear whether IR undergoes spatial or temporal changes during different stages of aging or neurodegeneration like Alzheimer's disease (AD). By profiling the transcriptome of Drosophila head cells at different ages, we observed a significant increase in IR events for many genes during aging. Differential IR affects distinct biological functions at different ages and occurs at several AD-associated genes in older adults. The increased nucleosome occupancy at the differentially retained introns in young animals suggests that it may regulate the level of IR during aging. Notably, an increase in the number of IR events was also observed in healthy older mouse and human brain tissues, as well as in the cerebellum and frontal cortex from independent AD cohorts. Genes with differential IR shared many common features, including shorter intron length, no perturbation in their mRNA level, and enrichment for biological functions that are associated with mRNA processing and proteostasis. The differentially retained introns identified in AD frontal cortex have higher GC content, with many of their mRNA transcripts showing an altered level of protein expression compared to control samples. Taken together, our results suggest that an increased IR is an conserved signature that is associated with aging. By affecting pathways involved in mRNA and protein homeostasis, changes of IR pattern during aging may regulate the transition from healthy to pathological state in late-onset sporadic AD.},

abstract = {Detailed analyses of transcriptome have revealed complexity in regulation of alternative splicing (AS). These AS events often undergo modulation by genetic variants. Here we analyse RNA-sequencing data of prefrontal cortex from 206 individuals in combination with their genotypes and identify cis-acting splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs) throughout the genome. These sQTLs are enriched among exonic and H3K4me3-marked regions. Moreover, we observe significant enrichment of sQTLs among disease-associated loci identified by GWAS, especially in schizophrenia risk loci. Closer examination of each schizophrenia-associated loci revealed four regions (each encompasses NEK4, FXR1, SNAP91 or APOPT1), where the index SNP in GWAS is in strong linkage disequilibrium with sQTL SNP(s), suggesting dysregulation of AS as the underlying mechanism of the association signal. Our study provides an informative resource of sQTL SNPs in the human brain, which can facilitate understanding of the genetic architecture of complex brain disorders such as schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Upregulation of the immune response may be involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia with changes occurring in both peripheral blood and brain tissue. To date, microarray technology has provided a limited view of specific inflammatory transcripts in brain perhaps due to sensitivity issues. Here we used SOLiD Next Generation Sequencing to quantify neuroimmune mRNA expression levels in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 20 individuals with schizophrenia and their matched controls. We detected 798 differentially regulated transcripts present in people with schizophrenia compared with controls. Ingenuity pathway analysis identified the inflammatory response as a key change. Using quantitative real-time PCR we confirmed the changes in candidate cytokines and immune modulators, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-1beta and SERPINA3. The density of major histocompatibility complex-II-positive cells morphologically resembling microglia was significantly increased in schizophrenia and correlated with IL-1beta expression. A group of individuals, most of whom had schizophrenia, were found to have increased inflammatory mRNA expression. In summary, we have demonstrated changes in an inflammatory response pathway that are present in approximately 40{\%} of people diagnosed with schizophrenia. This suggests that therapies aimed at immune system attenuation in schizophrenia may be of direct benefit in the brain.},

abstract = {Translation by the ribosome occurs by a complex mechanism involving the coordinated interaction of multiple nucleic acid and protein ligands. Here we use zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs) and sophisticated detection instrumentation to allow real-time observation of translation at physiologically relevant micromolar ligand concentrations. Translation at each codon is monitored by stable binding of transfer RNAs (tRNAs)-labelled with distinct fluorophores-to translating ribosomes, which allows direct detection of the identity of tRNA molecules bound to the ribosome and therefore the underlying messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence. We observe the transit of tRNAs on single translating ribosomes and determine the number of tRNA molecules simultaneously bound to the ribosome, at each codon of an mRNA molecule. Our results show that ribosomes are only briefly occupied by two tRNA molecules and that release of deacylated tRNA from the exit (E) site is uncoupled from binding of aminoacyl-tRNA site (A-site) tRNA and occurs rapidly after translocation. The methods outlined here have broad application to the study of mRNA sequences, and the mechanism and regulation of translation.},

abstract = {Single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing has recently been used to obtain full-length cDNA sequences that improve genome annotation and reveal RNA isoforms. Here, we used one such method called isoform sequencing from Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) to sequence a cDNA library from the Asian malaria mosquito Anopheles stephensi. More than 600 000 full-length cDNAs, referred to as reads of insert, were identified. Owing to the inherently high error rate of PacBio sequencing, we tested different approaches for error correction. We found that error correction using Illumina RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) generated more data than using the default SMRT pipeline. The full-length error-corrected PacBio reads greatly improved the gene annotation of Anopheles stephensi: 4867 gene models were updated and 1785 alternatively spliced isoforms were added to the annotation. In addition, six trans-splicing events, where exons from different primary transcripts were joined together, were identified in An. stephensi. All six trans-splicing events appear to be conserved in Culicidae, as they are also found in Anopheles gambiae and Aedes aegypti. The proteins encoded by trans-splicing events are also highly conserved and the orthologues of these proteins are cis-spliced in outgroup species, indicating that trans-splicing may arise as a mechanism to rescue genes that broke up during evolution.},

In this study, we explored the occurrence of fusion transcripts in normal human cortex along with single neurons and astrocytes. We identified 1305 non-redundant fusion events from 388 transcriptomes representing 59 human cortices and 329 single cells. Our results indicate while the majority of fusion transcripts in human cortex are intra-chromosomal (85{\%}), events found in single neurons and astrocytes were primarily inter-chromosomal (80{\%}). The number of fusions in single neurons was significantly higher than that in single astrocytes (p {\textless} 0.05), indicating fusion as a possible contributor towards transcriptome diversity in neuronal cells. The identified fusions were largely private and 4 specific recurring events were found both in cortex and in single neurons but not in astrocytes. We found a significant increase in the number of fusion transcripts in human brain with increasing age both in single cells and whole cortex (p {\textless} 0.0005 and {\textless} 0.005, respectively). This is likely one of the many possible contributors for the inherent plasticity of the adult brain. The fusion transcripts in fetal brain were enriched for genes for long-term depression; while those in adult brain involved genes enriched for long-term potentiation pathways. Our findings demonstrate fusion transcripts are naturally occurring phenomenon spanning across the health-disease continuum, and likely contribute to the diverse molecular network of human brain.},

We identified RORB as a marker of selectively vulnerable excitatory neurons in the entorhinal cortex and subsequently validated their depletion and selective susceptibility to neurofibrillary inclusions during disease progression using quantitative neuropathological methods. We also discovered an astrocyte subpopulation, likely representing reactive astrocytes, characterized by decreased expression of genes involved in homeostatic functions.

abstract = {Annotation of herpesvirus genomes has traditionally been undertaken through the detection of open reading frames and other genomic motifs, supplemented with sequencing of individual cDNAs. Second generation sequencing and high-density microarray studies have revealed vastly greater herpesvirus transcriptome complexity than is captured by existing annotation. The pervasive nature of overlapping transcription throughout herpesvirus genomes, however, poses substantial problems in resolving transcript structures using these methods alone. We present an approach that combines the unique attributes of Pacific Biosciences Iso-Seq long-read, Illumina short-read and deepCAGE (Cap Analysis of Gene Expression) sequencing to globally resolve polyadenylated isoform structures in replicating Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Our method, Transcriptome Resolution through Integration of Multi-platform Data (TRIMD), identifies nearly 300 novel EBV transcripts, quadrupling the size of the annotated viral transcriptome. These findings illustrate an array of mechanisms through which EBV achieves functional diversity in its relatively small, compact genome including programmed alternative splicing (e.g. across the IR1 repeats), alternative promoter usage by LMP2 and other latency-associated transcripts, intergenic splicing at the BZLF2 locus, and antisense transcription and pervasive readthrough transcription throughout the genome.},

abstract = {Alternative usage of transcript isoforms from the same gene has been hypothesized as an important feature in cancers. However, differential usage of gene transcripts between conditions (isoform switching) has not been comprehensively characterized in and across cancer types. To this end, we developed methods for identification and visualization of isoform switches with predicted functional consequences. Using these methods, we characterized isoform switching in RNA-seq data from {\textgreater}5,500 cancer patients covering 12 solid cancer types. Isoform switches with potential functional consequences were common, affecting approximately 19{\%} of multiple transcript genes. Among these, isoform switches leading to loss of DNA sequence encoding protein domains were more frequent than expected, particularly in pancancer switches. We identified several isoform switches as powerful biomarkers: 31 switches were highly predictive of patient survival independent of cancer types. Our data constitute an important resource for cancer researchers, available through interactive web tools. Moreover, our methods, available as an R package, enable systematic analysis of isoform switches from other RNA-seq datasets. Implications: This study indicates that isoform switches with predicted functional consequences are common and important in dysfunctional cells, which in turn means that gene expression should be analyzed at the isoform level.},

@article{Zhu2013,
abstract = {Background: Although intron loss in evolution has been described, the mechanism involved is still unclear. Three models have been proposed, the reverse transcriptase (RT) model, genomic deletion model and double-strand-break repair model. The RT model, also termed mRNA-mediated intron loss, suggests that cDNA molecules reverse transcribed from spliced mRNA recombine with genomic DNA causing intron loss. Many studies have attempted to test this model based on its predictions, such as simultaneous loss of adjacent introns, 3'-side bias of intron loss, and germline expression of intron-lost genes. Evidence either supporting or opposing the model has been reported. The mechanism of intron loss proposed in the RT model shares the process of reverse transcription with the formation of processed pseudogenes. If the RT model is correct, genes that have produced more processed pseudogenes are more likely to undergo intron loss.Results: In the present study, we observed that the frequency of intron loss is correlated with processed pseudogene abundance by analyzing a new dataset of intron loss obtained in mice and rats. Furthermore, we found that mRNA molecules of intron-lost genes are mostly translated on free cytoplasmic ribosomes, a feature shared by mRNA molecules of the parental genes of processed pseudogenes and long interspersed elements. This feature is likely convenient for intron-lost gene mRNA molecules to be reverse transcribed. Analyses of adjacent intron loss, 3'-side bias of intron loss, and germline expression of intron-lost genes also support the RT model.Conclusions: Compared with previous evidence, the correlation between the abundance of processed pseudogenes and intron loss frequency more directly supports the RT model of intron loss. Exploring such a correlation is a new strategy to test the RT model in organisms with abundant processed pseudogenes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Zhu and Niu; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Previous clinicopathologic studies addressing this issue have been largely retrospective or have consisted of relatively small numbers of cases. We examined the neuropathologic correlates of clinical parkinsonism in 78 cases with autopsy-confirmed AD prospectively enrolled in the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease. Sixteen (20.5{\%}) of the 78 AD cases showed concomitant PD pathology (AD/PD) as evidenced by the presence of nigral degeneration and Lewy bodies at any site. There were neocortical Lewy bodies in eight of these 16 cases.

In Alzheimer's disease (AD) there are several candidate genes reported that may be associated with the underlying pathology and are, in addition, alternatively spliced. Thus, AD is an ideal disease to examine how alternative splicing may affect pathology.

Although high levels of astrocyte-secreted glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP) in the CSF of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been reported, the levels of GFAP in the CSF have not been fully investigated in other neurological disorders that cause dementia, such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). In this study, we determined the levels of GFAP in the CSF of healthy control subjects and AD, DLB, and FTLD patients to address two questions: (i) Do the levels of GFAP differ among these disorders? and (ii) Can GFAP be used as a biomarker for the differential diagnosis of these neurodegenerative disorders? The levels of GFAP in AD, DLB, and FTLD patients were significantly higher than those in the healthy control subjects. Although the levels of GFAP were not significantly different between AD and DLB patients, a higher level of GFAP was observed in FTLD patients than in AD and DLB patients. It is concluded that representative neurological disorders causing dementia were associated with higher levels of GFAP in the CSF. We propose the following mechanism concerning the amount of glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). The increase in the release of GFAP into CSF is considered to reflect the sum of degeneration of astrocytes and astrocytosis. The sum of degeneration and astrocytosis or the GFAP release could be in the order of FTLD {\textgreater} DLB {\textgreater} AD {\textgreater} normal condition.

abstract = {Long-read sequencing of full-length cDNAs enables the detection of structures of aberrant splicing isoforms in cancer cells. These isoforms are occasionally translated, presented by HLA molecules, and recognized as neoantigens. This study used a long-read sequencer (MinION) to construct a comprehensive catalog of aberrant splicing isoforms in non-small-cell lung cancers, by which novel isoforms and potential neoantigens are identified. Full-length cDNA sequencing is performed using 22 cell lines, and a total of 2021 novel splicing isoforms are identified. The protein expression of some of these isoforms is then validated by proteome analysis. Ablations of a nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) factor, UPF1, and a splicing factor, SF3B1, are found to increase the proportion of aberrant transcripts. NetMHC evaluation of the binding affinities to each type of HLA molecule reveals that some of the isoforms potentially generate neoantigen candidates. We also identify aberrant splicing isoforms in seven non-small-cell lung cancer specimens. An enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot assay indicates that approximately half the peptide candidates have the potential to activate T cell responses through their interaction with HLA molecules. Finally, we estimate the number of isoforms in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets by referring to the constructed catalog and found that disruption of NMD factors is significantly correlated with the number of splicing isoforms found in the TCGA-Lung Adenocarcinoma data collection. Our results indicate that long-read sequencing of full-length cDNAs is essential for the precise identification of aberrant transcript structures in cancer cells.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder in which neuroinflammation has a critical function1. However, little is known about the contribution of the adaptive immune response in Alzheimer's disease2. Here, using integrated analyses of multiple cohorts, we identify peripheral and central adaptive immune changes in Alzheimer's disease. First, we performed mass cytometry of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and discovered an immune signature of Alzheimer's disease that consists of increased numbers of CD8+ T effector memory CD45RA+ (TEMRA) cells. In a second cohort, we found that CD8+ TEMRA cells were negatively associated with cognition. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that T cell receptor (TCR) signalling was enhanced in these cells. Notably, by using several strategies of single-cell TCR sequencing in a third cohort, we discovered clonally expanded CD8+ TEMRA cells in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we used machine learning, cloning and peptide screens to demonstrate the specificity of clonally expanded TCRs in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease to two separate Epstein–Barr virus antigens. These results reveal an adaptive immune response in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid in Alzheimer's disease and provide evidence of clonal, antigen-experienced T cells patrolling the intrathecal space of brains affected by age-related neurodegeneration.},

By contrast, sequencing technology can provide un-biased analysis of transcription at nucleotide resolution. Here we use this approach to investigate schizophrenia-associated cortical gene expression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The data was generated from 76 bp reads of RNA-Seq, aligned to the reference genome and assembled into transcripts for quantification of exons, splice variants and alternative promoters in postmortem superior temporal gyrus (STG/BA22) from 9 male subjects with schizophrenia and 9 matched non-psychiatric controls. Differentially expressed genes were then subjected to further sequence and functional group analysis. The output, amounting to more than 38 Gb of sequence, revealed significant alteration of gene expression including many previously shown to be associated with schizophrenia. Gene ontology enrichment analysis followed by functional map construction identified three functional clusters highly relevant to schizophrenia including neurotransmission related functions, synaptic vesicle trafficking, and neural development. Significantly, more than 2000 genes displayed schizophrenia-associated alternative promoter usage and more than 1000 genes showed differential splicing (FDR{\textless}0.05). Both types of transcriptional isoforms were exemplified by reads aligned to the neurodevelopmentally significant doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) gene.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This study provided the first deep and un-biased analysis of schizophrenia-associated transcriptional diversity within the STG, and revealed variants with important implications for the complex pathophysiology of schizophrenia.},

The molecular causes of AD are still poorly understood. However, recent studies have shown that Alternative Splicing (AS) is involved in the gene expression reprogramming associated with the functional changes observed in AD patients. In particular, mutations in cis-acting regulatory sequences as well as alterations in the activity and sub-cellular localization of trans-acting splicing factors and components of the spliceosome machinery are associated with splicing abnormalities in AD tissues, which may influence the onset and progression of the disease. In this review, we discuss the current molecular understanding of how alterations in the AS process contribute to AD pathogenesis. Finally, recent therapeutic approaches targeting aberrant AS regulation in AD are also reviewed.},

abstract = {Studies of the major psychoses, schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD), have traditionally focused on genetic and environmental risk factors, although more recent work has highlighted an additional role for epigenetic processes in mediating susceptibility. Since monozygotic (MZ) twins share a common DNA sequence, their study represents an ideal design for investigating the contribution of epigenetic factors to disease etiology. We performed a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation on peripheral blood DNA samples obtained from a unique sample of MZ twin pairs discordant for major psychosis. Numerous loci demonstrated disease-associated DNA methylation differences between twins discordant for SZ and BD individually, and together as a combined major psychosis group. Pathway analysis of our top loci highlighted a significant enrichment of epigenetic changes in biological networks and pathways directly relevant to psychiatric disorder and neurodevelopment. The top psychosis-associated, differentially methylated region, significantly hypomethylated in affected twins, was located in the promoter of ST6GALNAC1 overlapping a previously reported rare genomic duplication observed in SZ. The mean DNA methylation difference at this locus was 6{\%}, but there was considerable heterogeneity between families, with some twin pairs showing a 20{\%} difference in methylation. We subsequently assessed this region in an independent sample of postmortem brain tissue from affected individuals and controls, finding marked hypomethylation ({\textgreater}25{\%}) in a subset of psychosis patients. Overall, our data provide further evidence to support a role for DNA methylation differences in mediating phenotypic differences between MZ twins and in the etiology of both SZ and BD.},

Moreover, we have replicated genetic findings by targeted resequencing in independent Caucasian cohorts of French (n = 2182) and Canadian (n = 573) origin and by performing meta-analysis combining our data with previous genetic CLU screenings. RESULTS In the Flanders-Belgian cohort, we identified significant clustering in exons 5-8 of rare genetic variations leading to non-synonymous substitutions and a 9-bp insertion/deletion affecting the CLU $\beta$-chain (p = 0.02). Replicating this observation by targeted resequencing of CLU exons 5-8 in 2 independent Caucasian cohorts of French and Canadian origin identified identical as well as novel non-synonymous substitutions and small insertion/deletions. A meta-analysis, combining the datasets of the 3 cohorts with published CLU sequencing data, confirmed that rare coding variations in the CLU $\beta$-chain were significantly enriched in AD patients (OR(MH) = 1.96 [95{\%} CI = 1.18-3.25]; p = 0.009). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) association analysis indicated the common AD risk association (GWA SNP rs11136000, p = 0.013) in the 3 combined datasets could not be explained by the presence of the rare coding variations we identified. Further, high-density SNP mapping in the CLU locus mapped the common association signal to a more 5' CLU region. CONCLUSIONS We identified a new genetic risk association of AD with rare coding CLU variations that is independent of the 5' common association signal identified in the GWA studies. At this stage the role of these coding variations and their likely effect on the $\beta$-chain domain and CLU protein functioning remains unclear and requires further studies.},

However, although many thousands of alternatively spliced transcripts are routinely detected in RNA-seq studies, reliable large-scale mass spectrometry-based proteomics analyses identify only a small fraction of annotated alternative isoforms. The clearest finding from proteomics experiments is that most human genes have a single main protein isoform, while those alternative isoforms that are identified tend to be the most biologically plausible: those with the most cross-species conservation and those that do not compromise functional domains. Indeed, most alternative exons do not seem to be under selective pressure, suggesting that a large majority of predicted alternative transcripts may not even be translated into proteins.},

It is characterized by a decline in memory, language, problem-solving and other cognitive skills that affect a person's ability to perform everyday activities. This decline occurs because of the loss of neurons (particularly pyramidal cells) in regions of the brain involved in cognitive function. Eventually, the disease affects parts of the brain that enable a person to carry out basic bodily functions such as walking and swallowing. People in the final stages of the disease are bed-bound and require around-the-clock care.},

Here we describe a robust mRNA-Seq protocol (Smart-Seq) that is applicable down to single cell levels. Compared with existing methods, Smart-Seq has improved read coverage across transcripts, which enhances detailed analyses of alternative transcript isoforms and identification of single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We determined the sensitivity and quantitative accuracy of Smart-Seq for single-cell transcriptomics by evaluating it on total RNA dilution series. We found that although gene expression estimates from single cells have increased noise, hundreds of differentially expressed genes could be identified using few cells per cell type. Applying Smart-Seq to circulating tumor cells from melanomas, we identified distinct gene expression patterns, including candidate biomarkers for melanoma circulating tumor cells.

abstract = {Background: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) comprise a diverse class of transcripts that can regulate molecular and cellular processes in brain development and disease. LncRNAs exhibit cell type- and tissue-specific expression, but little is known about the expression and function of lncRNAs in the developing human brain. Furthermore, it has been unclear whether lncRNAs are highly expressed in subsets of cells within tissues, despite appearing lowly expressed in bulk populations. Results: We use strand-specific RNA-seq to deeply profile lncRNAs from polyadenylated and total RNA obtained from human neocortex at different stages of development, and we apply this reference to analyze the transcriptomes of single cells. While lncRNAs are generally detected at low levels in bulk tissues, single-cell transcriptomics of hundreds of neocortex cells reveal that many lncRNAs are abundantly expressed in individual cells and are cell type-specific. Notably, LOC646329 is a lncRNA enriched in single radial glia cells but is detected at low abundance in tissues. CRISPRi knockdown of LOC646329 indicates that this lncRNA regulates cell proliferation. Conclusion: The discrete and abundant expression of lncRNAs among individual cells has important implications for both their biological function and utility for distinguishing neural cell types.},

Methods: Custom capture sequencing was performed on ∼150 kb encompassing ABCA7 in 40 AA cases and 37 AA controls carrying the AA risk allele (rs115550680). Association testing was performed for an ABCA7 deletion identified in large AA data sets (discovery n 1,068; replication n 1,749) and whole exome sequencing of Caribbean Hispanic (CH) AD families. Results: A 44-base pair deletion (rs142076058) was identified in all 77 risk genotype carriers, which shows that the deletion is in high linkage disequilibrium with the risk allele. The deletion was assessed in a large data set (531 cases and 527 controls) and, after adjustments for age, sex, and APOE status, was significantly associated with disease (p 0.0002, odds ratio [OR] 2.13 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.42-3.20]). An independent data set replicated the association (447 cases and 880 controls, p 0.0117, OR 1.65 [95{\%} CI: 1.12-2.44]), and joint analysis increased the significance (p 1.414 × 10 -5, OR 1.81 [95{\%} CI: 1.38-2.37]). The deletion is common in AA cases (15.2{\%}) and AA controls (9.74{\%}), but in only 0.12{\%} of our non-Hispanic white cohort. Whole exome sequencing of multiplex, CH families identified the deletion cosegregating with disease in a large sibship. The deleted allele produces a stable, detectable RNA strand and is predicted to result in a frameshift mutation (p.Arg578Alafs) that could interfere with protein function. Conclusions: This common ABCA7 deletion could represent an ethnic-specific pathogenic alteration in AD.},

In the study of eukaryotic transcripts, this propensity of RT can produce an artificially deleted cDNA, which can be wrongly interpreted as an alternative transcript. Here, we have investigated the presence of such template-switching artifacts in cDNA databases, by scanning a collection of human splice sites (Information for the Coordinates of Exons, ICE database). We have confirmed several cases at the experimental level. Artifacts represent a significant portion of apparently spliced sequences using noncanonical splice signals but are rare in the context of the whole database. However, care should be taken in the annotation of alternative transcripts, especially when the RT used is poorly thermostable and when the putative intron is flanked by direct repeats, which are the substrate for template switching. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

G-PTM-D is a recently developed technique for global identification and localization of PTMs. Spectral file calibration prior to applying G-PTM-D, and algorithmic enhancements in the peptide database search significantly increase the accuracy, speed, and scope of PTM identification. We enhance G-PTM-D by using multinotch searches and demonstrate its effectiveness in identification of numerous types of PTMs including high-mass modifications such as glycosylations. The changes described in this work lead to a 20{\%} increase in the number of identified modifications and an order of magnitude decrease in search time. The complete workflow is implemented in MetaMorpheus, a software tool that integrates the database search procedure, identification of coisolated peptides, spectral calibration, and the enhanced G-PTM-D workflow. Multinotch searches are also shown to be useful in contexts other than G-PTM-D by producing superior results when used instead of standard narrow-window and open database searches.},

Accumulating transcriptomic studies of aging brains show the splicing disruption is a widespread hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we built ExonSkipAD, the ES annotation database aiming to provide a resource/reference for functional annotation of ES events in AD and identify therapeutic targets in exon units. We identified 16 414 genes that have {\~{}}156 K, {\~{}} 69 K, {\~{}} 231 K ES events from the three representative AD cohorts of ROSMAP, MSBB and Mayo, respectively. For these ES events, we performed multiple functional annotations relating to ES mechanisms or downstream. Specifically, through the functional feature retention studies followed by the open reading frames (ORFs), we identified 275 important cellular regulators that might lose their cellular regulator roles due to exon skipping in AD. ExonSkipAD provides twelve categories of annotations: gene summary, gene structures and expression levels, exon skipping events with PSIs, ORF annotation, exon skipping events in the canonical protein sequence, 3′-UTR located exon skipping events lost miRNA-binding sites, SNversus in the skipped exons with a depth of coverage, AD stage-associated exon skipping events, splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs) in the skipped exons, correlation with RNA-binding proteins, and related drugs {\&} diseases. ExonSkipAD will be a unique resource of transcriptomic diversity research for understanding the mechanisms of neurodegenerative disease development and identifying potential therapeutic targets in AD.

Due to the huge role played by mRNA in development and disease, several methods have been developed to sequence and characterize mRNA, with RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) emerging as the current method of choice particularly for large high-throughput studies. Short-read RNA-Seq which involves sequencing of short cDNA fragments and computationally assembling them to reconstruct the transcriptome, or aligning them to a reference is the most widely used approach. However, due to inherent limitations of this approach in de novo transcriptome assembly and isoform quantification, long-read RNA-Seq approaches, which also happen to be single molecule sequencing approaches, are increasingly becoming the standard for de novo transcriptome assembly and isoform quantification. In this chapter, we review the technical aspects of the current methods of RNA-Seq, both short and long-read approaches, and data analysis methods available. We discuss recent advances in single-cell RNA-Seq and direct RNA-Seq approaches, which perhaps will dominate the future of RNA-Seq.},

abstract = {Background: Generation of long ({\textgreater}5 Kb) DNA sequencing reads provides an approach for interrogation of complex regions in the human genome. Currently, large-insert whole genome sequencing (WGS) technologies from Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) enable analysis of chromosomal structural variations (SVs), but the cost to achieve the required sequence coverage across the entire human genome is high. Results: We developed a method (termed PacBio-LITS) that combines oligonucleotide-based DNA target-capture enrichment technologies with PacBio large-insert library preparation to facilitate SV studies at specific chromosomal regions. PacBio-LITS provides deep sequence coverage at the specified sites at substantially reduced cost compared with PacBio WGS. The efficacy of PacBio-LITS is illustrated by delineating the breakpoint junctions of low copy repeat (LCR)-associated complex structural rearrangements on chr17p11.2 in patients diagnosed with Potocki–Lupski syndrome (PTLS; MIM{\#}610883). We successfully identified previously determined breakpoint junctions in three PTLS cases, and also were able to discover novel junctions in repetitive sequences, including LCR-mediated breakpoints. The new information has enabled us to propose mechanisms for formation of these structural variants. Conclusions: The new method leverages the cost efficiency of targeted capture-sequencing as well as the mappability and scaffolding capabilities of long sequencing reads generated by the PacBio platform. It is therefore suitable for studying complex SVs, especially those involving LCRs, inversions, and the generation of chimeric Alu elements at the breakpoints. Other genomic research applications, such as haplotype phasing and small insertion and deletion validation could also benefit from this technology. Keywords:},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Because of the advantages of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) over microarrays, it is gaining widespread popularity for highly parallel gene expression analysis. For example, RNA-Seq is expected to be able to provide accurate identification and quantification of full-length splice forms. A number of informatics packages have been developed for this purpose, but short reads make it a difficult problem in principle. Sequencing error and polymorphisms add further complications. It has become necessary to perform studies to determine which algorithms perform best and which if any algorithms perform adequately. However, there is a dearth of independent and unbiased benchmarking studies. Here we take an approach using both simulated and experimental benchmark data to evaluate their accuracy. RESULTS: We conclude that most methods are inaccurate even using idealized data, and that no method is highly accurate once multiple splice forms, polymorphisms, intron signal, sequencing errors, alignment errors, annotation errors, and other complicating factors are present. These results point to the pressing need for further algorithm development.

abstract = {Hummingbirds can support their high metabolic rates exclusively by oxidizing ingested sugars, which is unsurprising given their sugar-rich nectar diet and use of energetically expensive hovering flight. However, they cannot rely on dietary sugars as a fuel during fasting periods, such as during the night, at first light, or when undertaking long-distance migratory flights, and must instead rely exclusively on onboard lipids. This metabolic flexibility is remarkable both in that the birds can switch between exclusive use of each fuel type within minutes and in that de novo lipogenesis from dietary sugar precursors is the principle way in which fat stores are built, sometimes at exceptionally high rates, such as during the few days prior to a migratory flight. The hummingbird hepatopancreas is the principle location of de novo lipogenesis and likely plays a key role in fuel selection, fuel switching, and glucose homeostasis. Yet understanding how this tissue, and the whole organism, achieves and moderates high rates of energy turnover is hampered by a fundamental lack of information regarding how genes coding for relevant enzymes differ in their sequence, expression, and regulation in these unique animals. To address this knowledge gap, we generated a de novo transcriptome of the hummingbird liver using PacBio full-length cDNA sequencing (Iso-Seq), yielding a total of 8.6Gb of sequencing data, or 2.6M reads from 4 different size fractions. We analyzed data using the SMRTAnalysis v3.1 Iso-Seq pipeline, including classification of reads and clustering of isoforms (ICE) followed by error-correction (Arrow). With COGENT, we clustered different isoforms into gene families to generate de novo gene contigs. We performed orthology analysis to identify closely related sequences between our transcriptome and other avian and human gene sets. We also aligned our transcriptome against the Calypte anna genome where possible. Finally, we closely examined homology of critical lipid metabolic genes between our transcriptome data and avian and human genomes. We confirmed high levels of sequence divergence within hummingbird lipogenic enzymes, suggesting a high probability of adaptive divergent function in the hepatic lipogenic pathways. Our results have leveraged cutting-edge technology and a novel bioinformatics pipeline to provide a compelling first direct look at the transcriptome of this incredible organism.},

abstract = {Background: RNA sequencing has opened new avenues for the study of transcriptome composition. Significant evidence has accumulated showing that the human transcriptome contains in excess of a hundred thousand different transcripts. However, it is still not clear to what extent this diversity prevails when considering the relative abundances of different transcripts from the same gene. Results: Here we show that, in a given condition, most protein coding genes have one major transcript expressed at significantly higher level than others, that in human tissues the major transcripts contribute almost 85 percent to the total mRNA from protein coding loci, and that often the same major transcript is expressed in many tissues. We detect a high degree of overlap between the set of major transcripts and a recently published set of alternatively spliced transcripts that are predicted to be translated utilizing proteomic data. Thus, we hypothesize that although some minor transcripts may play a functional role, the major ones are likely to be the main contributors to the proteome. However, we still detect a non-negligible fraction of protein coding genes for which the major transcript does not code a protein. Conclusions: Overall, our findings suggest that the transcriptome from protein coding loci is dominated by one transcript per gene and that not all the transcripts that contribute to transcriptome diversity are equally likely to contribute to protein diversity. This observation can help to prioritize candidate targets in proteomics research and to predict the functional impact of the detected changes in variation studies.},

abstract = {High-throughput short-read sequencing has revolutionized how transcriptomes are quantified and annotated. However, while Illumina short-read sequencers can be used to analyze entire transcriptomes down to the level of individual splicing events with great accuracy, they fall short of analyzing how these individual events are combined into complete RNA transcript isoforms. Because of this shortfall, long-distance information is required to complement short-read sequencing to analyze transcriptomes on the level of full-length RNA transcript isoforms. While long-read sequencing technology can provide this longdistance information, there are issues with both Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing technologies that prevent their widespread adoption. Briefly, PacBio sequencers produce low numbers of reads with high accuracy, while ONT sequencers produce higher numbers of reads with lower accuracy. Here, we introduce and validate a longread ONT-based sequencing method. At the same cost, our Rolling Circle Amplification to Concatemeric Consensus (R2C2) method generates more accurate reads of full-length RNA transcript isoforms than any other available long-read sequencing method. These reads can then be used to generate isoform-level transcriptomes for both genome annotation and differential expression analysis in bulk or single-cell samples.},

abstract = {In this study, we used the amplified isoform sequencing technique from Pacific Biosciences to characterize the poly(A)+ fraction of the lytic transcriptome of the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Our analysis detected 34 formerly unidentified protein-coding genes, ten non-coding RNAs, as well as 17 polycistronic and complex transcripts. This work also led us to identify many transcript isoforms, including 13 splice and 68 transcript end variants, as well as several transcript overlaps. Additionally, we determined previously unascertained transcriptional start and polyadenylation sites. We analyzed the transcriptional activity from the complementary DNA strand in five convergent HSV gene pairs with quantitative RT-PCR and detected antisense RNAs in each gene. This part of the study revealed an inverse correlation between the expressions of convergent partners. Our work adds new insights for understanding the complexity of the pervasive transcriptional overlaps by suggesting that there is a crosstalk between adjacent and distal genes through interaction between their transcription apparatuses. We also identified transcripts overlapping the HSV replication origins, which may indicate an interplay between the transcription and replication machineries. The relative abundance of HSV-1 transcripts has also been established by using a novel method based on the calculation of sequencing reads for the analysis.},

We characterized intra- and inter-individual methylomic variation across whole blood and multiple regions of the brain from multiple donors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Distinct tissue-specific patterns of DNA methylation were identified, with a highly significant over-representation of tissue-specific differentially methylated regions (TS-DMRs) observed at intragenic CpG islands and low CG density promoters. A large proportion of TS-DMRs were located near genes that are differentially expressed across brain regions. TS-DMRs were significantly enriched near genes involved in functional pathways related to neurodevelopment and neuronal differentiation, including BDNF, BMP4, CACNA1A, CACA1AF, EOMES, NGFR, NUMBL, PCDH9, SLIT1, SLITRK1 and SHANK3. Although between-tissue variation in DNA methylation was found to greatly exceed between-individual differences within any one tissue, we found that some inter-individual variation was reflected across brain and blood, indicating that peripheral tissues may have some utility in epidemiological studies of complex neurobiological phenotypes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This study reinforces the importance of DNA methylation in regulating cellular phenotype across tissues, and highlights genomic patterns of epigenetic variation across functionally distinct regions of the brain, providing a resource for the epigenetics and neuroscience research communities.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia worldwide with no curative therapies currently available. Previously, global transcriptome analysis of AD brains by microarray failed to identify the set of consistently deregulated genes for biomarker development of AD. Therefore, the molecular pathogenesis of AD remains largely unknown. Whole RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is an innovative technology for the comprehensive transcriptome profiling on a genome-wide scale that overcomes several drawbacks of the microarray-based approach. To identify biomarker genes for AD, we analyzed a RNA-Seq dataset composed of the comprehensive transcriptome of autopsized AD brains derived from two independent cohorts. We identified the core set of 522 genes deregulated in AD brains shared between both, compared with normal control subjects. They included downregulation of neuronal differentiation 6 (NeuroD6), a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor involved in neuronal development, differentiation, and survival in AD brains of both cohorts. We verified the results of RNA-Seq by analyzing three microarray datasets of AD brains different in brain regions, ethnicities, and microarray platforms. Thus, both RNA-Seq and microarray data analysis indicated consistent downregulation of NeuroD6 in AD brains. These results suggested that downregulation of NeuroD6 serves as a possible biomarker for AD brains.},

The complete viral genome is transcriptionally active during infection; however, a large part of its transcriptome has yet to be annotated. In this work, we applied the amplified isoform sequencing technique from Pacific Biosciences to characterize the lytic transcriptome of HCMV strain Towne varS. We developed a pipeline for transcript annotation using long-read sequencing data. We identified 248 transcriptional start sites, 116 transcriptional termination sites and 80 splicing events. Using this information, we have annotated 291 previously undescribed or only partially annotated transcript isoforms, including eight novel antisense transcripts and their isoforms, as well as a novel transcript (RS2) in the short repeat region, partially antisense to RS1. Similarly to other organisms, we discovered a high transcriptional diversity in HCMV, with many transcripts only slightly differing from one another. Comparing our transcriptome profiling results to an earlier ribosome footprint analysis, we have concluded that the majority of the transcripts contain multiple translationally active ORFs, and also that most isoforms contain unique combinations of ORFs. Based on these results, we propose that one important function of this transcriptional diversity may be to provide a regulatory mechanism at the level of translation.},

Use of the JunctionSeq analysis tool led to the detection of several novel exons and splice junctions in this gene, including two novel alternative tran-scription start sites which were found to display disproportionately strong neurally-regulated differential expression in several independent experiments. These high-throughput sequencing results were validated and augmented via targeted qPCR and long-read Pacific Biosciences SMRT sequencing. We confirmed the existence of numerous novel splice junctions and the selective upregulation of the two novel start sites. In addition, we identi-fied more than 20 novel isoforms of the Ttc8 gene that are co-expressed in this tissue.

Their applicability is extended by the ability to place molecules in the confined observation volume without interfering with their biological function. Here, we demonstrate that processive DNA synthesis thousands of bases in length was carried out by individual DNA polymerase molecules immobilized in the observation volumes of zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs) in high-density arrays. Selective immobilization of polymerase to the fused silica floor of the ZMW was achieved by passivation of the metal cladding surface using polyphosphonate chemistry, producing enzyme density contrasts of glass over aluminum in excess of 400:1. Yields of single-molecule occupancies of approximately 30{\%} were obtained for a range of ZMW diameters (70-100 nm). Results presented here support the application of immobilized single DNA polymerases in ZMW arrays for long-read-length DNA sequencing.},

abstract = {The only recognized genetic determinant of the common forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the epsilon 4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE). To identify new candidate genes, we recently performed transcriptomic analysis of 2741 genes in chromosomal regions of interest using brain tissue of AD cases and controls. From 82 differentially expressed genes, 1156 polymorphisms were genotyped in two independent discovery subsamples (n=945). Seventeen genes exhibited at least one polymorphism associated with AD risk, and following correction for multiple testing, we retained the interleukin (IL)-33 gene. We first confirmed that the IL-33 expression was decreased in the brain of AD cases compared with that of controls. Further genetic analysis led us to select three polymorphisms within this gene, which we analyzed in three independent case-control studies. These polymorphisms and a resulting protective haplotype were systematically associated with AD risk in non-APOE epsilon 4 carriers. Using a large prospective study, these associations were also detected when analyzing the prevalent and incident AD cases together or the incident AD cases alone. These polymorphisms were also associated with less cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in the brain of non-APOE epsilon 4 AD cases. Immunohistochemistry experiments finally indicated that the IL-33 expression was consistently restricted to vascular capillaries in the brain. Moreover, IL-33 overexpression in cellular models led to a specific decrease in secretion of the A beta(40) peptides, the main CAA component. In conclusion, our data suggest that genetic variants in IL-33 gene may be associated with a decrease in AD risk potentially in modulating CAA formation.},

The search for new treatments is made ever more urgent by prospects for increasing prevalence due to population aging. Mouse models are one of the most important research tools for finding new treatments for AD. Here, we review those models. We begin by briefly reviewing the AD genetics on which mouse models are based and then consider the most common mouse models of AD, including mice transgenic for human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) and beta-amyloid (A$\beta$), mice expressing mutant presenilin genes, mice modeling tau's role in AD, and apolipoprotein E models. The discussion highlights key features and important differences between these mouse models. We conclude with a discussion about the role of AD mouse models in the translational pipeline. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {Todevelop targeted intervention strategies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease,wefirst need to identify early markers of brain changes that occur before the onset of cognitive impairment. Here, we examine changes in resting-state brain function in humans from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging.Wecomparedlongitudinal changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), assessedby15O-water PET, over amean 7 year period between participants who eventually developed cognitive impairment (n=22) and those who remained cognitively normal (n= 99). Annual PET assessments began an average of 11 years before the onset of cognitive impairment in the subsequently impaired group, so all participants were cognitively normal during the scanning interval. A voxel-based mixed model analysis was used to compare groups with and without subsequent impairment. Participants with subsequent impairment showed significantly greater longitudinal rCBF increases in orbitofrontal, medial frontal, and anterior cingulate regions, and greater longitudinal decreases in parietal, temporal, and thalamic regions compared with those who maintained cognitive health. These changes were linear in nature and were not influenced by longitudinal changes in regional tissue volume. Although all participants were cognitively normal during the scanning interval, most of the accelerated rCBF changes seen in the subsequently impaired group occurred within regions thought to be critical for the maintenance of cognitive function. These changes also occurred within regions that show early accumulation of pathology in Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that there may be a connection between early pathologic change and early changes in brain function. {\textcopyright} 2013 the authors.},

abstract = {This chapter focuses on thin-layer, ion-exchange, affinity chromatography and paper and gel electrophoresis of nucleic acids and their monomeric constituents. It discusses the use of chromatography and electrophoresis in sequence analysis and nucleoprotein separation. The base composition of an unknown RNA or DNA molecule is obtained by first degrading the polymer to purine and pyrimidine bases, nucleosides, or nucleotides, separating the individual species, and estimating the proportion of each. The advantage of nuclease degradation is that products can usually be applied directly to ion-exchange columns or thin layers without the neutralization or removal of the reagent. Chemical degradation tends to destroy many of the modified sugar residues found in tRNA species. The common purine and pyrimidine bases possess ring nitrogen atoms and, with the exception of thymine (DNA) and uracil (RNA), exocyclic amino groups that accept protons. Hence, by changing the pH of the solvent, the degree of protonation on each type of base can be controlled. {\textcopyright} 1983, Elsevier Science {\&} Technology. All rights reserved.},

Given its ability to obtain full-length transcripts without assembly, isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) of transcriptomes by PacBio is advantageous for genome annotation, identification of novel genes and isoforms, as well as the discovery of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). In addition, Iso-Seq gives access to the direct detection of alternative splicing, alternative polyadenylation (APA), gene fusion, and DNA modifications. Such applications of Iso-Seq facilitate the understanding of gene structure, post-transcriptional regulatory networks, and subsequently proteomic diversity. In this review, we summarize its applications in plant transcriptome study, specifically pointing out challenges associated with each step in the experimental design and highlight the development of bioinformatic pipelines. We aim to provide the community with an integrative overview and a comprehensive guidance to Iso-Seq, and thus to promote its applications in plant research.},

abstract = {The molecular mechanisms controlling synaptogenesis in the central nervous system (CNS) are poorly understood. Previous reports showed that a glia-derived factor strongly promotes synapse development in cultures of purified CNS neurons. Here, we identify this factor as cholesterol complexed to apolipoprotein E-containing lipoproteins. CNS neurons produce enough cholesterol to survive and grow, but the formation of numerous mature synapses demands additional amounts that must be provided by glia. Thus, the availability of cholesterol appears to limit synapse development. This may explain the delayed onset of CNS synaptogenesis after glia differentiation and neurobehavioral manifestations of defects in cholesterol or lipoprotein homeostasis.},

abstract = {Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disease currently affecting 1.75{\%} of the US population, with projected growth to 3.46{\%} by 2050. Identifying common genetic variants driving differences in transcript expression that confer AD risk is necessary to elucidate AD mechanism and develop therapeutic interventions. We modify the FUSION transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) pipeline to ingest gene expression values from multiple neocortical regions. Methods: A combined dataset of 2003 genotypes clustered to 1000 Genomes individuals from Utah with Northern and Western European ancestry (CEU) was used to construct a training set of 790 genotypes paired to 888 RNASeq profiles from temporal cortex (TCX = 248), prefrontal cortex (FP = 50), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG = 41), superior temporal gyrus (STG = 34), parahippocampal cortex (PHG = 34), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC = 461). Following within-tissue normalization and covariate adjustment, predictive weights to impute expression components based on a gene's surrounding cis-variants were trained. The FUSION pipeline was modified to support input of pre-scaled expression values and support cross validation with a repeated measure design arising from the presence of multiple transcriptome samples from the same individual across different tissues. Results: Cis-variant architecture alone was informative to train weights and impute expression for 6780 (49.67{\%}) autosomal genes, the majority of which significantly correlated with gene expression; FDR {\textless} 5{\%}: N = 6775 (99.92{\%}), Bonferroni: N = 6716 (99.06{\%}). Validation of weights in 515 matched genotype to RNASeq profiles from the CommonMind Consortium (CMC) was (72.14{\%}) in DLPFC profiles. Association of imputed expression components from all 2003 genotype profiles yielded 8 genes significantly associated with AD (FDR {\textless} 0.05): APOC1, EED, CD2AP, CEACAM19, CLPTM1, MTCH2, TREM2, and KNOP1. Conclusions: We provide evidence of cis-genetic variation conferring AD risk through 8 genes across six distinct genomic loci. Moreover, we provide expression weights for 6780 genes as a valuable resource to the community, which can be abstracted across the neocortex and a wide range of neuronal phenotypes.},

abstract = {Background: ABCA7 was identified as a risk gene for Alzheimer's disease in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). It was one of the genes most strongly associated with risk of Alzheimer's disease in a Belgian cohort. Using targeted resequencing, we investigated ABCA7 in this cohort with the aim to directly detect rare and common variations in this gene associated with Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Methods: We did massive parallel resequencing of ABCA7 after HaloPlex target enrichment of the exons, introns, and regulatory regions in 772 unrelated patients with Alzheimer's disease (mean age at onset 74{\textperiodcentered}6 years [SD 8{\textperiodcentered}9]) recruited at two memory clinics in Flanders, Belgium, and 757 geographically matched community-dwelling controls (mean age at inclusion 73{\textperiodcentered}9 years [8{\textperiodcentered}0]). After bioinformatic processing, common variants were analysed with conditional logistic regression and rare variant association analysis was done in Variant Association Tools. To explore an observed founder effect, additional unrelated patients with Alzheimer's disease (n=183, mean age at onset 78{\textperiodcentered}8 years [SD 6{\textperiodcentered}0]) and control individuals (n=265, mean age at inclusion 56{\textperiodcentered}9 years [10{\textperiodcentered}8]) from the same cohort who had not been included in massive parallel resequencing because of insufficient biosamples were screened for the ABCA7 frameshift mutation Glu709fs with Sanger sequencing. The effect of loss-of-function mutations on ABCA7 expression was investigated with quantitative real-time PCR in post-mortem brains of patients (n=3) and control individuals (n=4); nonsense mediated mRNA decay was investigated in lymphoblast cell lines from three predicted loss-of-function mutation carriers from the cohort of 772 patients with Alzheimer's disease. Findings: An intronic low-frequency variant rs78117248 (minor allele frequency 3{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} in 58 patients with Alzheimer's disease and in controls 1{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} in 28 controls) showed strongest association with Alzheimer's disease (odds ratio 2{\textperiodcentered}07, 95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}31-3{\textperiodcentered}27; p=0{\textperiodcentered}0016), and remained significant after conditioning for the GWAS top single nucleotide polymorphisms rs3764650, rs4147929, and rs3752246 (2{\textperiodcentered}00, 1{\textperiodcentered}22-3{\textperiodcentered}26; p=0{\textperiodcentered}006). We identified an increased frequency of predicted loss-of-function mutations in the patients compared with the controls (relative risk 4{\textperiodcentered}03, 95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}75-9{\textperiodcentered}29; p=0{\textperiodcentered}0002). One frameshift mutation (Glu709fs) showed a founder effect in the study population, and was found to segregate with disease in a family with autosomal dominant inheritance of Alzheimer's disease. Expression of ABCA7 was reduced in the two carriers of loss-of-function mutations found only in patients with Alzheimer's disease (Glu709fs and Trp1214*) compared with four non-carrier controls (relative expression 0{\textperiodcentered}45, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}25-0{\textperiodcentered}84; p=0{\textperiodcentered}002) and in lymphoblast cell lines from three carriers of Glu709fs compared with those from two non-carrier controls. Interpretation: We propose that a low-frequency variant can explain the association between ABCA7 and Alzheimer's disease, and the evidence of loss-of-function mutations in this risk gene suggests that partial loss-of-function of ABCA7 could be a potential pathogenetic mechanism of Alzheimer's disease.

abstract = {Aging brains undergo cognitive decline, associated with decreased neuronal synapse number and function and altered metabolism. Astrocytes regulate neuronal synapse formation and function in development and adulthood, but whether these properties change during aging, contributing to neuronal dysfunction, is unknown. We addressed this by generating aged and adult astrocyte transcriptomes from multiple mouse brain regions. These data provide a comprehensive RNA-seq database of adult and aged astrocyte gene expression, available online as a resource. We identify astrocyte genes altered by aging across brain regions and regionally unique aging changes. Aging astrocytes show minimal alteration of homeostatic and neurotransmission-regulating genes. However, aging astrocytes upregulate genes that eliminate synapses and partially resemble reactive astrocytes. We further identified heterogeneous expression of synapse-regulating genes between astrocytes from different cortical regions. We find that alterations to astrocytes in aging create an environment permissive to synapse elimination and neuronal damage, potentially contributing to aging-associated cognitive decline. The aging brain has reduced synapse number and decreased neuronal activity, functions regulated by neighboring astrocytes. Boisvert et al. investigated if aging astrocytes are contributing to these changes and found that aged astrocytes show increased expression of genes for inflammatory and synapse elimination pathways and decreased cholesterol synthesis enzymes.},

abstract = {The neuronal microtubule-associated protein tau is abnormally hyperphosphorylated and aggregated into neurofibrillary tangles in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative disorders. The adult human brain expresses six isoforms of tau generated by alternative splicing of exons 2, 3, and 10 of its pre-mRNA. Exon 10 encodes the second microtubule-binding repeat of tau. Its alternative splicing produces tau isoforms with either three or four microtubule-binding repeats, termed 3R-tau and 4Rtau. In the normal adult human brain, the level of 3R-tau is approximately equal to that of 4R-tau. Several silent and intronic mutations of the tau gene associated with FTDP-17T (frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 and specifically characterized by tau pathology) only disrupt exon 10 splicing, but do not influence the primary sequence of the tau protein. Thus, abnormal exon 10 splicing is sufficient to cause neurodegeneration and dementia. Here, we review the regulation of tau exon 10 splicing by cis-elements and trans-factors and summarize all the mutations associated with FTDP-17T and related tauopathies. The findings suggest that correction of exon 10 splicing may be a potential target for tau exon 10 splicing-related tauopathies.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing (AS) allows generation of cell type–specific mRNA transcripts and contributes to hallmarks of cancer. Genome-wide analysis for AS in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), however, is limited. We sought to obtain a comprehensive AS landscape in HCC and define tumor-associated variants. Single-molecule real-time long-read RNA sequencing was performed on patient-derived HCC cells, and presence of splice junctions was defined by SpliceMap-LSC-IDP algorithm. We obtained an all-inclusive map of annotated AS variants and further discovered 362 alternative spliced variants that are not previously reported in any database (neither RefSeq nor GENCODE). They were mostly derived from intron retention and early termination codon with an in-frame open reading frame in 81.5{\%}. We corroborated many of these predicted unannotated and annotated variants to be tumor specific in an independent cohort of primary HCC tumors and matching nontumoral liver. Using the combined Sanger sequencing and TaqMan junction assays, unique and common expressions of spliced variants including enzyme regulators (ARHGEF2, SERPINH1), chromatin modifiers (DEK, CDK9, RBBP7), RNA-binding proteins (SRSF3, RBM27, MATR3, YBX1), and receptors (ADRM1, CD44v8-10, vitamin D receptor, ROR1) were determined in HCC tumors. We further focused functional investigations on ARHGEF2 variants (v1 and v3) that arise from the common amplified site chr.1q22 of HCC. Their biological significance underscores two major cancer hallmarks, namely cancer stemness and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition–mediated cell invasion and migration, although v3 is consistently more potent than v1. Conclusion: Alternative isoforms and tumor-specific isoforms that arise from aberrant splicing are common during the liver tumorigenesis. Our results highlight insights gained from the analysis of AS in HCC.},

abstract = {Background: The human genome contains "dark" gene regions that cannot be adequately assembled or aligned using standard short-read sequencing technologies, preventing researchers from identifying mutations within these gene regions that may be relevant to human disease. Here, we identify regions with few mappable reads that we call dark by depth, and others that have ambiguous alignment, called camouflaged. We assess how well long-read or linked-read technologies resolve these regions. Results: Based on standard whole-genome Illumina sequencing data, we identify 36,794 dark regions in 6054 gene bodies from pathways important to human health, development, and reproduction. Of these gene bodies, 8.7{\%} are completely dark and 35.2{\%} are ≥ 5{\%} dark. We identify dark regions that are present in protein-coding exons across 748 genes. Linked-read or long-read sequencing technologies from 10x Genomics, PacBio, and Oxford Nanopore Technologies reduce dark protein-coding regions to approximately 50.5{\%}, 35.6{\%}, and 9.6{\%}, respectively. We present an algorithm to resolve most camouflaged regions and apply it to the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project. We rescue a rare ten-nucleotide frameshift deletion in CR1, a top Alzheimer's disease gene, found in disease cases but not in controls. Conclusions: While we could not formally assess the association of the CR1 frameshift mutation with Alzheimer's disease due to insufficient sample-size, we believe it merits investigating in a larger cohort. There remain thousands of potentially important genomic regions overlooked by short-read sequencing that are largely resolved by long-read technologies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Gene annotations, such as those in GENCODE, are derived primarily from alignments of spliced cDNA sequences and protein sequences. The impact of RNA-seq data on annotation has been confined to major projects like ENCODE and Illumina Body Map 2.0. RESULTS We aligned 21,504 Illumina-sequenced human RNA-seq samples from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) to the human genome and compared detected exon-exon junctions with junctions in several recent gene annotations. We found 56,861 junctions (18.6{\%}) in at least 1000 samples that were not annotated, and their expression associated with tissue type. Junctions well expressed in individual samples tended to be annotated. Newer samples contributed few novel well-supported junctions, with the vast majority of detected junctions present in samples before 2013. We compiled junction data into a resource called intropolis available at http://intropolis.rail.bio . We used this resource to search for a recently validated isoform of the ALK gene and characterized the potential functional implications of unannotated junctions with publicly available TRAP-seq data. CONCLUSIONS Considering only the variation contained in annotation may suffice if an investigator is interested only in well-expressed transcript isoforms. However, genes that are not generally well expressed and nonetheless present in a small but significant number of samples in the SRA are likelier to be incompletely annotated. The rate at which evidence for novel junctions has been added to the SRA has tapered dramatically, even to the point of an asymptote. Now is perhaps an appropriate time to update incomplete annotations to include splicing present in the now-stable snapshot provided by the SRA.},

One of these transcripts (S182) corresponds to a novel gene whose product is predicted to contain multiple transmembrane domains and resembles an integral membrane protein. Five different missense mutations have been found that cosegregate with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease.

Although Tau PTM maps reveal heterogeneity across subjects, a subset of PTMs display high occupancy and frequency for AD, suggesting importance in disease. Unsupervised analyses indicate that PTMs occur in an ordered manner, leading to Tau aggregation. The processive addition and minimal set of PTMs associated with seeding activity was further defined by analysis of size-fractionated Tau. To summarize, features in the Tau protein critical for disease intervention at different stages of disease are identified, including enrichment of 0N and 4R isoforms, underrepresentation of the C terminus, an increase in negative charge in the proline-rich region (PRR), and a decrease in positive charge in the microtubule binding domain (MBD).},

abstract = {Eighty-three brains obtained at autopsy from nondemented and demented individuals were examined for extracellular amyloid deposits and intraneuronal neurofibrillary changes. The distribution pattern and packing density of amyloid deposits turned out to be of limited significance for differentiation of neuropathological stages. Neurofibrillary changes occurred in the form of neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads. The distribution of neuritic plaques varied widely not only within architectonic units but also from one individual to another. Neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads, in contrast, exhibited a characteristic distribution pattern permitting the differentiation of six stages. The first two stages were characterized by an either mild or severe alteration of the transentorhinal layer Pre-$\alpha$ (transentorhinal stages I-II). The two forms of limbic stages (stages III-IV) were marked by a conspicuous affection of layer Pre-$\alpha$ in both transentorhinal region and proper entorhinal cortex. In addition, there was mild involvement of the first Ammon's horn sector. The hallmark of the two isocortical stages (stages V-VI) was the destruction of virtually all isocortical association areas. The investigation showed that recognition of the six stages required qualitative evaluation of only a few key preparations. {\textcopyright} 1991 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {This study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first application of whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) to cells isolated from postmortem human brain by laser capture microdissection. We investigated the transcriptome of dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells in postmortem human hippocampus in 79 subjects with mental illness (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression) and nonpsychiatric controls. We show that the choice of normalization approach for analysis of RNA-seq data had a strong effect on results; under our experimental conditions a nonstandard normalization method gave superior results. We found evidence of disrupted signaling by miR-182 in mental illness. This was confirmed using a novel method of leveraging microRNA genetic variant information to indicate active targeting. In healthy subjects and those with bipolar disorder, carriers of a high- vs those with a low-expressing genotype of miR-182 had different levels of miR-182 target gene expression, indicating an active role of miR-182 in shaping the DG transcriptome for those subject groups. By contrast, comparing the transcriptome between carriers of different genotypes among subjects with major depression and schizophrenia suggested a loss of DG miR-182 signaling in these conditions.},

We identified a differentially methylated region in the ankyrin 1 (ANK1) gene that was associated with neuropathology in the entorhinal cortex, a primary site of AD manifestation. This region was confirmed as being substantially hypermethylated in two other cortical regions (superior temporal gyrus and prefrontal cortex), but not in the cerebellum, a region largely protected from neurodegeneration in AD, or whole blood obtained pre-mortem from the same individuals. Neuropathology-associated ANK1 hypermethylation was subsequently confirmed in cortical samples from three independent brain cohorts.

abstract = {The parietal cortex of the human brain plays a unique role in the coordination of movement and in the integration of signals from the other cortices. Because of its extensive connections and involvement in many higher-order cognitive functions, neurodegenerative changes in the parietal lobe are believed to be crucial in the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Little is known about the transcriptome of this part of the human brain or how it is perturbed by the neurodegenerative process. To that end, we performed mRNA sequencing using the Illumina RNA-Seq technique on samples derived from normal and AD parietal lobes. Gene expression analysis evaluating alternatively spliced isoform expression and promoter usage revealed surprisingly elevated transcriptome activity in the AD condition. This phenomenon was particularly apparent in the alternative usage of transcriptional start sites. A Gene Ontology analysis of the differentially expressed genes revealed enrichment in the functional pathways related to lipid metabolism, thus highlighting the importance of astrocyte activity in the neurodegenerative process. We also identified an upregulation of the diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) gene in AD, as the result of a splicing switch toward shorter, intron-retaining isoforms driven by alternative promoters and was coupled with a simultaneous decrease in the abundance of protein-coding transcripts. These two DBI isoforms have not been described previously. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {The accumulation of beta-amyloid (A$\beta$) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles consisting of hyperphosphorylated tau protein are pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) commonly modeled in mice using known human familial mutations; however, the loss of neurons also found to occur in AD is rarely observed in such models. The mechanism of neuron degeneration remains unclear but is of great interest as it is very likely an important factor for the onset of adverse memory deficits occurring in individuals with AD. The role of A$\beta$ in the neuronal degeneration is a matter of controversial debates. In the present study we investigated the impact of extracellular plaque A$\beta$ versus intraneuronal A$\beta$ on neuronal cell death. The thalamus and the frontal cortex of the APP/PS1KI mouse model were chosen for stereological quantification representing regions with plaques only (thalamus) or plaques as well as intraneuronal A$\beta$ (frontal cortex). A loss of neurons was found in the frontal cortex at the age of 6 months coinciding with the decrease of intraneuronal immunoreactivity, suggesting that the neurons with early intraneuronal A$\beta$ accumulation were lost. Strikingly, no neuron loss was observed in the thalamus despite the development of abundant plaque pathology with levels comparable to the frontal cortex. This study suggests that plaques have no effect on neuron death whereas accumulation of intraneuronal A$\beta$ may be an early transient pathological event leading to neuron loss in AD.},

abstract = {Precise identification of RNA-coding regions and transcriptomes of eukaryotes is a significant problem in biology. Currently, eukaryote transcriptomes are analyzed using deep short-read sequencing experiments of complementary DNAs. The resulting short-reads are then aligned against a genome and annotated junctions to infer biological meaning. Here we use long-read complementary DNA datasets for the analysis of a eukaryotic transcriptome and generate two large datasets in the human K562 and HeLa S3 cell lines. Both data sets comprised at least 4 million reads and had median read lengths greater than 500 bp. We show that annotation-independent alignments of these reads provide partial gene structures that are very much in-line with annotated gene structures, 15{\%} of which have not been obtained in a previous de novo analysis of short reads. For long-noncoding RNAs (i.e., lncRNA) genes, however, we find an increased fraction of novel gene structures among our alignments. Other important aspects of transcriptome analysis, such as the description of cell type-specific splicing, can be performed in an accurate, reliable and completely annotation-free manner, making it ideal for the analysis of transcriptomes of newly sequenced genomes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that long read sequence can be assembled into full-length transcripts with considerable success. Our method is applicable to all long read sequencing technologies.},

abstract = {The effect of the apolipoprotein E genotype on the development of late onset Alzheimer's disease is still debated. Neuropathological studies of Alzheimer's disease have found a great extent of amyloid deposition in cortex and blood vessel walls in association with the apolipoprotein E $\epsilon${\{}lunate{\}}4 genotype [Rebeck G. W. et al. (1993) Neuron 11, 575-580; Schmechel et al. (1993) Proc. natn. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90, 9649-9653]. In contrast, the relationship of apolipoprotein E genotype to neurofibrillary pathology in Alzheimer's disease has been less clear. In this study we present evidence on the influence of the apolipoprotein E genotype on Alzheimer's disease related pathology in a series of 76 autopsy cases that had pathology that fulfilled the CERAD criteria for Alzheimer's disease. We found that the presence of the apolipoprotein E $\epsilon${\{}lunate{\}}4 allele is correlated with increased amounts of both amyloid and neuritic pathology in the neocortex as determined using an image analysis system. Comparison of plaque and tangle densities with the allele doses of $\epsilon${\{}lunate{\}}2 and $\epsilon${\{}lunate{\}}4 revealed a striking parallelism, suggesting that the alleles exert their effects very early in the pathological process before deposition of plaques and tangles. Although the apolipoprotein E $\epsilon${\{}lunate{\}}2 allele had a protective effect against both amyloid deposition and neurofibrillary tangle formation, in the presence of the $\epsilon${\{}lunate{\}}4 allele this protective effect against neuritic pathology was less marked than against amyloid deposition. This differential effect on amyloid deposition and the accumulation of neuritic pathology suggests that different molecular mechanisms are involved in the effect of apolipoprotein E on amyloid deposition and on tau phosphorylation. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

For intact RNA, gene expression profiles from rRNA-depletion and poly-A enrichment are similar. In addition, rRNA depletion enables effective analysis of degraded RNA samples. This study provides a broad foundation for cross-platform standardization, evaluation and improvement of RNA-seq.},

abstract = {A monoclonal antibody to the microtubule-associated protein tau (tau) labeled some neurofibrillary tangles and plaque neurites, the two major locations of paired-helical filaments (PHF), in Alzheimer disease brain. The antibody also labeled isolated PHF that had been repeatedly washed with NaDodSO4. Dephosphorylation of the tissue sections with alkaline phosphatase prior to immunolabeling dramatically increased the number of tangles and plaques recognized by the antibody. The plaque core amyloid was not stained in either dephosphorylated or nondephosphorylated tissue sections. On immunoblots PHF polypeptides were labeled readily only when dephosphorylated. In contrast, a commercially available monoclonal antibody to a phosphorylated epitope of neurofilaments that labeled the tangles and the plaque neurites in tissue did not label any PHF polypeptides on immunoblots. The PHF polypeptides, labeled with the monoclonal antibody to tau, electrophoresed with those polypeptides recognized by antibodies to isolated PHF. The antibody to tau-labeled microtubules from normal human brains assembled in vitro but identically treated Alzheimer brain preparations had to be dephosphorylated to be completely recognized by this antibody. These findings suggest that tau in Alzheimer brain is an abnormally phosphorylated protein component of PHF.},

abstract = {1,2 on behalf of MGS 5 We undertook an RNA sequencing (RNAseq)-based transcriptomic profiling study on lymphoblastoid cell lines of a European ancestry sample of 529 schizophrenia cases and 660 controls, and found 1058 genes to be differentially expressed by affection status. These differentially expressed genes were enriched for involvement in immunity, especially the 697 genes with higher expression in cases. Comparing the current RNAseq transcriptomic profiling to our previous findings in an array-based study of 268 schizophrenia cases and 446 controls showed a highly significant positive correlation over all genes. Fifteen (18{\%}) of the 84 genes with significant (false discovery rate o0.05) expression differences between cases and controls in the previous study and analyzed here again were differentially expressed by affection status here at a genome-wide significance level (Bonferroni P o0.05 adjusted for 8141 analyzed genes in total, or P o {\~{}} 6.1 × 10 − 6), all with the same direction of effect, thus providing corroborative evidence despite each sample of fully independent subjects being studied by different technological approaches. Meta-analysis of the RNAseq and array data sets (797 cases and 1106 controls) showed 169 additional genes (besides those found in the primary RNAseq-based analysis) to be differentially expressed, and provided further evidence of immune gene enrichment. In addition to strengthening our previous array-based gene expression differences in schizophrenia cases versus controls and providing transcriptomic support for some genes implicated by other approaches for schizophrenia, our study detected new genes differentially expressed in schizophrenia. We highlight RNAseq-based differential expression of various genes involved in neurodevelopment and/or neuronal function, and discuss caveats of the approach.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Resolving tandemly repeated genomic sequences is a necessary step in improving our understanding of the human genome. Short tandem repeats, or microsatellites, are often used as molecular markers in genetics, and clinically, variation in microsatellites can lead to genetic disorders like Huntingon's diseases. Accurately resolving repeats, and in particular tandem repeats (TRs), remains a challenging task in genome alignment, assembly, and variation calling. Though tools have been developed for detecting microsatellites in short-read sequencing data, these are limited in the size and types of events they can resolve. Single-molecule sequencing technologies may potentially resolve a broader spectrum of tandem repeats given their increased length, but require new approaches given their significantly higher raw error-profiles. However, due to inherent error profiles of the single molecule technologies, these reads presents a unique challenge in terms of accurately identifying and estimating the tandem repeats. RESULTS: Here we present PacmonSTR a reference-based probabilistic approach to identify the TR region and estimate the number of these TR elements in long DNA reads. We present a multi-step approach that requires as input, a reference region and the reference tandem repeat element. Initially, the TR region is identified from the long DNA reads via a 3-stage modified smith-waterman approach and then, expected number of TR elements are calculated using a pair-Hidden Markov Models (pairHMM) based method. Finally, TR based genotype selection (or clustering: homozygous/heterozygous) is performed with gaussian-mixture-models (GMMs), utilizing the Akaike information criteria (AIC), and coverage expectations.

abstract = {The acceleration of DNA sequencing in samples from patients and population studies has resulted in extensive catalogues of human genetic variation, but the interpretation of rare genetic variants remains problematic. A notable example of this challenge is the existence of disruptive variants in dosage-sensitive disease genes, even in apparently healthy individuals. Here, by manual curation of putative loss-of-function (pLoF) variants in haploinsufficient disease genes in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)1, we show that one explanation for this paradox involves alternative splicing of mRNA, which allows exons of a gene to be expressed at varying levels across different cell types. Currently, no existing annotation tool systematically incorporates information about exon expression into the interpretation of variants. We develop a transcript-level annotation metric known as the ‘proportion expressed across transcripts', which quantifies isoform expression for variants. We calculate this metric using 11,706 tissue samples from the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) project2 and show that it can differentiate between weakly and highly evolutionarily conserved exons, a proxy for functional importance. We demonstrate that expression-based annotation selectively filters 22.8{\%} of falsely annotated pLoF variants found in haploinsufficient disease genes in gnomAD, while removing less than 4{\%} of high-confidence pathogenic variants in the same genes. Finally, we apply our expression filter to the analysis of de novo variants in patients with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability or developmental disorders to show that pLoF variants in weakly expressed regions have similar effect sizes to those of synonymous variants, whereas pLoF variants in highly expressed exons are most strongly enriched among cases. Our annotation is fast, flexible and generalizable, making it possible for any variant file to be annotated with any isoform expression dataset, and will be valuable for the genetic diagnosis of rare diseases, the analysis of rare variant burden in complex disorders, and the curation and prioritization of variants in recall-by-genotype studies.},

We detected the temporal order of their enzymatic incorporation into a growing DNA strand with zero-mode waveguide nanostructure arrays, which provide optical observation volume confinement and enable parallel, simultaneous detection of thousands of single-molecule sequencing reactions. Conjugation of fluorophores to the terminal phosphate moiety of the dNTPs allows continuous observation of DNA synthesis over thousands of bases without steric hindrance. The data report directly on polymerase dynamics, revealing distinct polymerization states and pause sites corresponding to DNA secondary structure. Sequence data were aligned with the known reference sequence to assay biophysical parameters of polymerization for each template position. Consensus sequences were generated from the single-molecule reads at 15-fold coverage, showing a median accuracy of 99.3{\%}, with no systematic error beyond fluorophore-dependent error rates.},

@article{Bresson2015,
abstract = {The human nuclear poly(A)-binding protein PABPN1 has been implicated in the decay of nuclear noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). In addition, PABPN1 promotes hyperadenylation by stimulating poly(A)-polymerases (PAP$\alpha$/$\gamma$), but this activity has not previously been linked to the decay of endogenous transcripts. Moreover, the mechanisms underlying target specificity have remained elusive. Here, we inactivated PAP-dependent hyperadenylation in cells by two independent mechanisms and used an RNA-seq approach to identify endogenous targets. We observed the upregulation of various ncRNAs, including snoRNA host genes, primary miRNA transcripts, and promoter upstream antisense RNAs, confirming that hyperadenylation is broadly required for the degradation of PABPN1-targets. In addition, we found that mRNAs with retained introns are susceptible to PABPN1 and PAP$\alpha$/$\gamma$-mediated decay (PPD). Transcripts are targeted for degradation due to inefficient export, which is a consequence of reduced intron number or incomplete splicing. Additional investigation showed that a genetically-encoded poly(A) tail is sufficient to drive decay, suggesting that degradation occurs independently of the canonical cleavage and polyadenylation reaction. Surprisingly, treatment with transcription inhibitors uncouples polyadenylation from decay, leading to runaway hyperadenylation of nuclear decay targets. We conclude that PPD is an important mammalian nuclear RNA decay pathway for the removal of poorly spliced and nuclear-retained transcripts.},

abstract = {We previously demonstrated that the Alzheimer's disease (AD) associated risk allele, rs3865444C, results in a higher surface density of CD33 on monocytes. Here, we find alternative splicing of exon 2 to be the primary mechanism of the genetically driven differential expression of CD33 protein. We report that the risk allele, rs3865444C, is associated with greater cell surface expression of CD33 in both subjects of European and African-American ancestry and that there is a single haplotype influencing CD33 surface expression. A meta-analysis of the two populations narrowed the number of significant SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r2 {\textgreater} 0.8) with rs3865444 to just five putative causal variants associated with increased protein expression. Using gene expression data from flow-sorted CD14+CD16- monocytes from 398 healthy subjects of three populations, we show that the rs3865444C risk allele is strongly associated with greater expression of CD33 exon 2 (pMETA = 2.36 × 10-60). Western blotting confirms increased protein expression of the full-length CD33 isoform containing exon 2 relative to the rs3865444C allele (P {\textless} 0.0001). Of the variants in strong LD with rs3865444, rs12459419, which is located in a putative SRSF2 splice site of exon 2, is the most likely candidate to mediate the altered alternative splicing of CD33's Immunoglobulin V-set domain 2 and ultimately influence AD susceptibility. {\textcopyright} The Author 2013.

abstract = {From the ENCODE project, it is realized that almost every base of the entire human genome is transcribed. One class of transcripts resulting from this arises from the conjoined gene, which is formed by combining the exons of two or more distinct (parent) genes lying on the same strand of a chromosome. Only a very limited number of such genes are known, and the definition and terminologies used for them are highly variable in the public databases. In this work, we have computationally identified and manually curated 751 conjoined genes (CGs) in the human genome that are supported by at least one mRNA or EST sequence available in the NCBI database. 353 representative CGs, of which 291 (82{\%}) could be confirmed, were subjected to experimental validation using RT-PCR and sequencing methods. We speculate that these genes are arising out of novel functional requirements and are not merely artifacts of transcription, since more than 70{\%} of them are conserved in other vertebrate genomes. The unique splicing patterns exhibited by CGs reveal their possible roles in protein evolution or gene regulation. Novel CGs, for which no transcript is available, could be identified in 80{\%} of randomly selected potential CG forming regions, indicating that their formation is a routine process. Formation of CGs is not only limited to human, as we have also identified 270 CGs in mouse and 227 in drosophila using our approach. Additionally, we propose a novel mechanism for the formation of CGs. Finally, we developed a database, ConjoinG, which contains detailed information about all the CGs (800 in total) identified in the human genome. In summary, our findings reveal new insights about the functionality of CGs in terms of another possible mechanism for gene regulation and genomic evolution and the mechanism leading to their formation. {\textcopyright} 2010 Prakash et al.},

abstract = {Although a genetic basis of depression has been well established in twin studies, identification of genome-wide significant loci has been difficult. We hypothesized that bivariate analyses of findings from a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (meta-GWASs) of the broad depression phenotype with those from meta-GWASs of self-reported and recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder and schizophrenia would enhance statistical power to identify novel genetic loci for depression. LD score regression analyses were first used to estimate the genetic correlations of broad depression with self-reported MDD, recurrent MDD, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Then, we performed four bivariate GWAS analyses. The genetic correlations (rg ± SE) of broad depression with self-reported MDD, recurrent MDD, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia were 0.79 ± 0.07, 0.24 ± 0.08, 0.53 ± 0.09 and 0.57 ± 0.05, respectively. From a total of 20 independent genome-wide significant loci, 13 loci replicated of which 8 were novel for depression. These were MUC21 for the broad depression phenotype with self-reported MDD and ZNF804A, MIR3143, PSORS1C2, STK19, SPATA31D1, RTN1 and TCF4 for the broad depression phenotype with schizophrenia. Post-GWAS functional analyses of these loci revealed their potential biological involvement in psychiatric disorders. Our results emphasize the genetic similarities among different psychiatric disorders and indicate that cross-disorder analyses may be the best way forward to accelerate gene finding for depression, or psychiatric disorders in general.},

abstract = {Across a variety of Mendelian disorders,∼50-75{\%} of patients do not receive a genetic diagnosis by exome sequencing indicating disease-causing variants in non-coding regions. Although genome sequencing in principle reveals all genetic variants, their sizeable number and poorer annotation make prioritization challenging. Here, we demonstrate the power of transcriptome sequencing to molecularly diagnose 10{\%} (5 of 48) of mitochondriopathy patients and identify candidate genes for the remainder. We find a median of one aberrantly expressed gene, five aberrant splicing events and six mono-allelically expressed rare variants in patient-derived fibroblasts and establish disease-causing roles for each kind. Private exons often arise from cryptic splice sites providing an important clue for variant prioritization. One such event is found in the complex I assembly factor TIMMDC1 establishing a novel disease-associated gene. In conclusion, our study expands the diagnostic tools for detecting non-exonic variants and provides examples of intronic loss-of-function variants with pathological relevance.},

abstract = {Like a jigsaw puzzle with large pieces, a genome sequenced with long reads is easier to assemble. However, recent sequencing technologies have favored lowering per-base cost at the expense of read length. This has dramatically reduced sequencing cost, but resulted in fragmented assemblies, which negatively affect downstream analyses and hinder the creation of finished (gapless, high-quality) genomes. In contrast, emerging long-read sequencing technologies can now produce reads tens of kilobases in length, enabling the automated finishing of microbial genomes for under {\$}1000. This promises to improve the quality of reference databases and facilitate new studies of chromosomal structure and variation. We present an overview of these new technologies and the methods used to assemble long reads into complete genomes.},

abstract = {Extensive changes in DNA methylation have been observed in schizophrenia (SC) and bipolar disorder (BP), and may contribute to the pathogenesis of these disorders. Here, we performed genome-scale DNA methylation profiling using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (MeDIP-seq) on two brain regions (including frontal cortex and anterior cingulate) in 5 SC, 7 BP and 6 normal subjects. Comparing with normal controls, we identified substantial differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in these two brain regions of SC and BP. To our surprise, different brain regions show completely distinct distributions of DMRs across the genomes. In frontal cortex of both SC and BP subjects, we observed widespread hypomethylation as compared to normal controls, preferentially targeting the terminal ends of the chromosomes. In contrast, in anterior cingulate, both SC and BP subjects displayed extensive gain of methylation. Notably, in these two brain regions of SC and BP, only a few DMRs overlapped with promoters, whereas a greater proportion occurs in introns and intergenic regions. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that important psychiatric disorder-related biological processes such as neuron development, differentiation and projection may be altered by epigenetic changes located in the intronic regions. Transcriptome analysis revealed consistent dysfunctional processes with those determined by DMRs. Furthermore, DMRs in the same brain regions from SC and BP could successfully distinguish BP and/or SC from normal controls while differentially expressed genes could not. Overall, our results support a major role for brain-region-dependent aberrant DNA methylation in the pathogenesis of these two disorders.},

abstract = {Background: Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a heterogenous neurodegenerative disorder named after its pathological features. It has long been considered a disease of genetic origin. Recently, the GGC repeated expansion in the 5′-untranslated region (5 UTR) of the NOTCH2NLC gene has been found in adult-onset NIID in Japanese individuals. This study was aimed to investigate the causative mutations of NIID in Chinese patients. Methods: Fifteen patients with NIID were identified from five academic neurological centres. Biopsied skin samples were analysed by histological staining, immunostaining and electron microscopic observation. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and long-read sequencing (LRS) were initially performed in three patients with NIID. Repeat-primed PCR was conducted to confirm the genetic variations in the three patients and the other 12 cases. Results: Our patients included 14 adult-onset patients and 1 juvenile-onset patient characterised by degeneration of multiple nervous systems. All patients were identified with intranuclear inclusions in the nuclei of fibroblasts, fat cells and ductal epithelial cells of sweat glands. The WGS failed to find any likely pathogenic variations for NIID. The LRS successfully identified that three patients with adult-onset NIID showed abnormalities of GGC expansion in 5′UTR of the NOTCH2NLC gene. The GGC repeated expansion was further confirmed by repeat-primed PCR in seven familial cases and eight sporadic cases. Conclusion: Our findings provided evidence that confirmed the GGC repeated expansion in the 5′UTR of the NOTCH2NLC gene is associated with the pathogenesis of NIID. Additionally, the GGC expansion was not only responsible for adult-onset patients, but also responsible for juvenile-onset patients.},

@article{Loomis2013,
abstract = {The human fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene contains a (CGG) n trinucleotide repeat in its 59 untranslated region (5′UTR). Expansions of this repeat result in a number of clinical disorders with distinct molecular pathologies, including fragile X syndrome (FXS; full mutation range, greater than 200 CGG repeats) and fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS; premutation range, 55-200 repeats). Study of these diseases has been limited by an inability to sequence expanded CGG repeats, particularly in the full mutation range, with existing DNA sequencing technologies. Single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing provides an approach to sequencing that is fundamentally different from other "next-generation" sequencing platforms, and is well suited for long, repetitive DNA sequences. We report the first sequence data for expanded CGG-repeat FMR1 alleles in the full mutation range that reveal the confounding effects of CGG-repeat tracts on both cloning and PCR. A unique feature of SMRT sequencing is its ability to yield real-time information on the rates of nucleoside addition by the tethered DNA polymerase; for the CGG-repeat alleles, we find a strand-specific effect of CGG-repeat DNA on the interpulse distance. This kinetic signature reveals a novel aspect of the repeat element; namely, that the particular G bias within the CGG/CCG-repeat element influences polymerase activity in a manner that extends beyond simple nearest-neighbor effects. These observations provide a baseline for future kinetic studies of repeat elements, as well as for studies of epigenetic and other chemical modifications thereof.},

SK-BR-3 is known to be highly rearranged, although much of the variation is in complex and repetitive regions that may be underreported. Addressing this, we sequenced SK-BR-3 using long-read single molecule sequencing from Pacific Biosciences and develop one of the most detailed maps of structural variations (SVs) in a cancer genome available, with nearly 20,000 variants present, most of which were missed by short-read sequencing. Surrounding the important ERBB2 oncogene (also known as HER2), we discover a complex sequence of nested duplications and translocations, suggesting a punctuated progression. Full-length transcriptome sequencing further revealed several novel gene fusions within the nested genomic variants. Combining long-read genome and transcriptome sequencing enables an in-depth analysis of how SVs disrupt the genome and sheds new light on the complex mechanisms involved in cancer genome evolution.},
