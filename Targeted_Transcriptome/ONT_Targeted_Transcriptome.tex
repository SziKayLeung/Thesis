\section{Introduction}

Mouse samples (n = 24) prepared for targeted transcriptome sequencing on the Sequel were also sequenced on the Oxford Nanopore's MinION (n = 18), using the same kit (LSK-109) and pipeline as the nanopore whole transcriptome sequencing. 

\section{Results}
Following library preparation and nanopore sequencing (Chapter X), a total of 28.54M reads (39.68Gb) were generated across two flow cells and a total of 22.8M (80\%) reads were successfully basecalled using Guppy.
